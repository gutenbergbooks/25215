		<h2 class="section_title">INTRODUCTION</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">I have</span> called this little collection of articles
		which I have written &#8220;THREE
		THINGS&#8221; because to me there seem to
		be just three essentials to strive after in life.
		Truth&#8212;Common Sense and Happiness. To be
		able to see the first enables us to employ the
		second, and so realise the third. And in these
		papers I have tried to suggest some points which
		may be of use to others who, like myself, are
		endeavouring to reason out ideas to a good end.</p>

		<p>How often one sees people who could be very
		happy, and who yet with incredible blindness
		and stupidity are running their heads against
		stone walls (or feather beds!) and destroying
		all chance of peace for themselves, their mates,
		and their households!</p>

		<p>Everything is very simple when it is analysed
		down to what nature meant in the affair&#8212;and by
		doing this one gets a broader perspective.</p>

		<p>For instance, nature meant one thing in the
		connection of man and woman&#8212;and civilisation
		has grafted quite another meaning into it, and
		<a class="pagenum" id="pageviii" title="viii">&nbsp;</a>the two things are often at war in the State
		called marriage! In the chapters devoted to
		this subject I have tried to exploit some points
		which are not generally faced, in the hope that if
		understood they might help towards Happiness.</p>

		<p>The thing which more than half of humanity
		seems to forget is <i>the end they have in view</i>!
		They desire something really ardently, and yet
		appear incapable of keeping their minds from
		straying into side issues, which must logically militate
		against, and probably prevent, their desire&#8217;s
		accomplishment. This is very strange! A woman
		for instance profoundly desires to retain a man&#8217;s
		love when she sees it is waning&#8212;but her
		wounded vanity causes her to use methods of reproach
		and recrimination towards him, calculated
		certainly to defeat her end, and accelerate
		his revolt.</p>

		<p>I feel that in publishing this little collection
		in America I must ask indulgence for the parts
		which seem to touch upon exclusively English
		aspects of the subjects under discussion&#8212;because
		the main ideas apply to humanity in general
		and not to any particular country. The
		paper on Divorce is of course written from an
		English point of view, but its suggestions may
		be of some use to those who are interested in the
		<a class="pagenum" id="pageix" title="ix">&nbsp;</a>question of divorce in the abstract, and are on
		the alert as to the results of its facilities in
		America. I do not presume to offer an opinion
		as to its action there; and in this paper am not
		making the slightest criticism of the American
		divorce laws&#8212;only stating what seems to me
		should rule all such questions in any country,
		namely,&#8212;Common sense and consideration for
		the welfare of the community.</p>

		<p>Above all things I am an incorrigible optimist!
		and I truly believe that the world is advancing
		in every way and that we are already in
		the dawn of a new era of the understanding, and
		the exploitation for our benefit of the great
		forces of nature. But we of the majority of
		non-scientists, were until so lately sound asleep
		to any speculative ideas, and just drowsed on
		without thinking at all, that it behooves us now
		that we are awake in the new century to try to
		see straight and analyse good and evil.</p>

		<p>In my papers on the Responsibility of
		Motherhood I may be quite out of touch with
		American ideas&#8212;but I will chance that in the
		hope that some parts of them may be of service,
		taken broadly.</p>

			THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> Old order changeth, giving place to
		New; and it would be well to realise this
		everlasting fact before we decide that
		the world is waxing evil, and the times are waxing
		late. And who can say that out of the seething
		of the present some noble and glorious ideals
		of life for men and women may not spring?</p>

		<p>Surely it is unwise to read in the writing upon
		the wall, as so many do, only a pessimistic presage
		of inevitable death. If there is writing for
		students of evolution to read, then it should be
		taken as a warning indication which direction to
		avoid and which to take. Unrest is a sign, not
		of decay, but of life. Stagnation alone gives
		warning of death.</p>

		<p>And there are a number of facts to be faced
		before we can give an opinion either way.</p>

		<p>The first of these is, that all civilised nations
		are endeavouring to stamp out ignorance and
		disease, and that an enormous advance in this
		<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2">&nbsp;</a>direction can be observed in the last fifty years.
		And, taking a general view of the civilised
		peoples, a far greater number of their units now
		lead less dreadful and degraded lives.</p>

		<p>And surely these indications of mankind&#8217;s advancement
		are as plain as are some other signs
		of decline.</p>

		<p>The stirring up of the masses by insufficient
		education is bound to produce unrest, and until
		the different elements have assorted themselves
		into their new places in the scheme of things,
		how can there be tranquillity? All is out of
		balance, and has disturbed the machinery of the
		country&#8217;s life, for the time being. But if the
		aim has been for enlightenment, the eventual
		outcome must be good.</p>

		<p>All scum in a boiling pot rises to the top, and
		makes itself seen, concealing the pure liquid beneath,
		until it is skimmed off. And so we have
		political demagogues shouting the untenable fallacy
		that all men are equal, together with other
		flamboyant nonsense; and hooligan suffragists
		smashing windows. But all these are only the
		scum upon the outside of a great upward movement
		in mankind, and are not to be taken as
		the incontestable proof of the vicious condition
		of the whole mass.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3">&nbsp;</a>The spirit that is abroad, though one of great
		unrest, is not one of decadence, but of progress.
		But it would be folly not to admit that there are
		aspects of it which presage disaster unless directed,
		just as the pot will boil over if not
		watched.</p>

		<p>It may be interesting to scrutinise, with unemotional
		common sense, some of the causes of
		the present state of things, and perhaps from
		this investigation come to some conclusions as
		to their remedy or encouragement.</p>

		<p>Nature, whether human, animal, or vegetable,
		will not be hurried, or she produces the abnormal.
		Until about a hundred years ago everything
		seemed to be moving on with a very slow
		and gradual evolution. Some things changed a
		little, others it would seem, not at all. And
		then, after the first quarter of the nineteenth
		century, Science and Invention appeared to join
		hands, and, with small beginnings, gradually
		assuming mammoth proportions, to revolutionise
		the very universe. The result has been to
		make life easy to a class which formerly had to
		work hard for the bare necessities of existence.
		With this came education. The lowest of the
		people were taught to read and write, and the
		most ill-chosen and elementary book-knowledge
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4">&nbsp;</a>was flung upon unploughed soil, unprepared for
		its reception. Nature was hurried, and began
		to produce, not fair flowers at once, but the abnormal
		and diseased. A little knowledge is a
		dangerous thing.</p>

		<p>The education these crude minds received was
		not of the sort to show them their ignorance,
		and implant in them a noble desire for more
		teaching, so as to achieve a gradual advancement,
		but was just sufficient to stir up discontent with
		what was, and produce countless square pegs,
		clamouring to get into round holes for which
		they were unfitted.</p>

		<p>Mechanical inventions did away with numbers
		of home duties, and even the meagre education
		the masses then received was enough to cause
		them to throw grave doubts upon the accepted
		religion of the country. The timid souls were
		released from the fear of hell, as a powerful
		factor for the determining of their actions. The
		bold felt they would have the support and sympathy
		of numbers of their fellows in breaking
		up old beliefs, and the intelligent of both kinds
		refused to swallow many of the dogmas any
		longer.</p>

		<p>Thus the bridle which, through the Christian
		ages, had guided mankind, became as a mere
		<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5">&nbsp;</a>thread. And all these loosened steeds ran wild
		and are still running wild, until enlightenment
		shall come to them, and they will perceive that
		each individual is responsible to God for himself.</p>

		<p>The cry that the churches are emptying is perhaps
		true; and if it is a fact, then of what use
		to lament it? It would be more logical to search
		for the cause. If people do not come of their
		own accord, there is no law to oblige them to do
		so. Consequently, if the churches wish for their
		return, it is their business to provide fare which
		will induce them to take this course.</p>

		<p>Education has encouraged men and women to
		think for themselves, and the religiously minded,
		who would willingly remain under some guidance,
		have begun to perceive how very wide
		apart Christ&#8217;s beautiful teaching is from the interpretation
		of it which they often receive in
		church; while the others, who had never any religious
		aspirations at all, are glad that the weight
		of public opinion and custom no longer forces
		them into irksome attendance. To fill churches
		with worshippers drawn there largely through
		hope of Heaven or fear of Hell, or because it
		was considered respectable and custom bound
		them to conform to its mandates, surely could
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6">&nbsp;</a>not have been very acceptable to God. And
		the percentage who went truly to pour forth their
		love and worship, are still pouring it forth, because
		it came, and comes, from their hearts
		whether they attend church or no.</p>

		<p>The modern spirit is full of what Edmond
		Holmes calls the desire to ask the teacher or
		person in authority for his credentials. And if
		these are not entirely satisfactory, the influence
		he can hope to wield will be nil.</p>

		<p>To deplore anything that may happen to a
		country, or to ourselves, is waste of time. We
		should search for the reason of it, and if it
		proves to be because there is some ineradicable
		cause, intelligence should then be used to better
		the condition which results. Worship of something
		glorious and beyond ourselves will always
		swell the human heart, and if the accepted forms
		of the religion of a country can no longer produce
		this emotion, it is not because the human
		heart is changing, but because there is something
		in those forms which no longer fulfils its mission.</p>

		<p>The cry of the fear of the net of Rome is
		futile also. People drift to where they belong,
		and Rome seems to offer to take all spiritual
		responsibility from the shoulders of her children.
		It gives them an emotional satisfaction which
		<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7">&nbsp;</a>brings comfort to all, and amongst these any of
		hysterical nature probably become far happier
		and better citizens under her wing than they
		would otherwise have been. No nets will catch
		the expanding soul which is rising out of its paltry
		self into ideals nearer to God.</p>

		<p>During the earlier days when religion held
		sway in England over at least nine-tenths of female
		lives, superfluous women were content as a
		rule to lead grey, uneventful existences, making
		no more mark on their time than if they had
		been flocks of sheep. But with the breakdown
		of this force, and greater freedom of ideas, they
		have brought themselves into prominence&#8212;the
		scum as a shrieking sisterhood, and the pure elements
		unobtrusively, as leaders of countless
		noble works.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, in every class of the community
		the desire &#8220;to move&#8221; is felt. Travelling, formerly
		the luxury of the rich, now is indulged in
		by an ever-increasing company. The aspect of
		family life is changed, and amusement is within
		the reach of all.</p>

		<p>It is not reasonable to suppose with this total
		alteration in the view of existence, that many
		things that we held beautiful and sacred should
		not have gone by the board&#8212;things such as filial
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8">&nbsp;</a>respect, gentle manners, chivalry, obedience.
		We are undoubtedly in an unpleasant state of
		incompletion as a nation to-day, but by no means
		in one of decadence. And if only the two great
		dangers do not swamp us&#8212;a mawkish and hysterical
		humanitarianism, and the heedless pursuit
		of pleasure as the only end&#8212;the upward
		tendency of progress is bound to go on. Inventions,
		aided by science in all its ramifications,
		have made life pleasant, and all these benefits
		have come too quickly for the recipients to be
		prepared to receive them with calm. Their equilibrium
		is disturbed, and they are led into exaggerations,
		and so the ugly side of the spirit
		of the Great Unrest is born. But, underneath,
		the English people are a sane, healthy stock in
		mind and body, and when education has opened
		their minds and broadened their understanding,
		they will surely allow their birthright of common
		sense among the nations to have sway
		again. Instead of standing aside and lamenting
		that times are evil and that the nation is going
		down hill, it behoves all thinking people to
		gather their forces together and seriously apply
		themselves to consider how they can better this
		condition of things. In their daily life they can
		do so by setting up a high standard of sanity
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>and right behaviour, by the encouragement of
		fine aims and high ends, by the firm avoidance
		of hypocrisy and hysterical altruism, and by intelligent
		explanation to those under their care
		of the reason why individual responsibility is
		necessary for the welfare of the community at
		large.</p>

		<p>And a most important lesson for every one to
		learn is the law of cause and effect. The great
		rush of modern life is apt to produce an inconsequence
		of action. Anything good or bad is indulged
		in without time for thought as to its result.
		But the law of the boomerang is immutable,
		and its action goes on for ever&#8212;<em>what we
		send out we receive again, sooner or later, for
		good or ill</em>.</p>

		<p>The first principle of that great and wonderful
		wave of &#8220;New Thought&#8221; which is sweeping
		over America, and is beginning to find some
		understanding in this country, is that the responsibility
		of each individual&#8217;s well-being rests with
		himself, and that his environment is the result of
		what his consciousness has been able to attract
		to himself.</p>

		<p>And, as no one limits us but ourselves, as soon
		as a man&#8217;s consciousness begins strongly to create
		in his own mind new and better conditions,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10">&nbsp;</a>he will inevitably draw them to himself in fact.
		From God there can emanate nothing but Good.
		It is the individual&#8217;s own action which brings
		his punishment, or reward. If this fundamental
		principle could be investigated by responsible
		scientists, unhampered by theological influences,
		and with no prejudice as to the idea&#8217;s being regarded
		as a mere <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culte</em>, its exactness could perhaps
		be mathematically proved beyond a cavilling
		doubt. Possibly then the doctrine might
		be allowed to be taught in the public schools,
		to the everlasting benefit of the growing
		race.</p>

		<p>To say the least of it, it would inculcate an
		immense self-respect.</p>

		<p>There should not be, and I believe there is
		not, any law which can prevent the lowest in the
		land from rising to the highest place&#8212;<em>if he is
		fitted for it</em>. It is the ceaseless cry of the unfit
		unit for some situation above his capabilities,
		which is a distressing feature of modern life.
		But, even in this, the spirit shown in the desire
		to rise is good; while if he had the will to fit
		himself for what he aspires to, it would be
		splendid and great. And these are the men
		and women who succeed, no matter what avocations
		they may be engaged in. The others,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>the shouters, only hamper the wheels of progress
		and fall eventually as the dust in the ruts.</p>

		<p>Formerly there was a hard line drawn between
		&#8220;gentlemen&#8221; and common men. And there
		were all sorts of things that, however bad he
		might be, a &#8220;gentleman&#8221; did not do; or if he
		did commit these actions, his punishment was
		swift. He was obliged to face the ordeal of a
		duel, or he received the cut direct from his own
		class.</p>

		<p>These ideas of behaviour, accompanied by the
		responsibility for the welfare of numbers of tenants
		upon his property&#8212;responsibility very often
		nobly sustained&#8212;produced in the old English
		aristocrat a very fine specimen indeed. And
		from him downwards in all the social classes, a
		high tone of honour was maintained. But now
		the democratic idea is sweeping away these
		classes and these standards. The State is taking
		the power for good from the individual, and the
		machine is crushing the man; so it behooves all
		serious thinkers more than ever to use their logical
		common sense to supply the place once occupied
		by the old ideals. Nothing is so arrogant
		as ignorance&#8212;and loud shouting ever concealed
		an empty pate.</p>

		<p>Part of the crude spirit of the Great Unrest
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>of to-day manifests itself by the effort of those
		beneath to demonstrate <em>in words</em> that they are
		the equals of those above them. And, pitiful
		and ridiculous as this is, the spirit arose in good.
		It is because those underneath <em>desire</em> to be the
		equals of those above them, that they use the
		only means their limited understandings provide
		them with, to try to obtain their ends. You
		never hear of numbers of people shouting that
		they are the equals of the tramp in the street!</p>

		<p>So it shows that even in this, the Great Unrest
		is an uplifting force. And when reason and education
		have directed its current, surely we may
		hope that we shall arise again as a nation, like
		a giant refreshed with wine.</p>

		<p>The study of the atavism of races, the study
		of heredity, the study of the influence of the welfare
		of the mother upon her unborn child, are
		all useful and expanding studies for ordinary
		thinking minds, and are quite within the scope
		of the average intelligence. But the modern
		hatred of all restraint&#8212;another failing born in
		the good of desire for freedom&#8212;makes it difficult
		to preach any course of action which would
		involve curtailment of time or pleasure.</p>

		<p>You often hear people say about some misfortune,
		&#8220;Just as I expected, such and such happened,&#8221;
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13">&nbsp;</a>and they do not stop to realise that their
		expectancy helped the thing which they feared,
		to materialise. No one can deny the force of
		imagination. Its existence has been abundantly
		proved. For instance, there was a case which
		was in the newspapers some time ago, of the
		guard on a Russian train who believed he was
		locked into the cold-storage van, and wrote a
		letter describing how he was being frozen to
		death. And he was actually found dead in the
		morning, although the temperature of the car
		had never gone below freezing point!</p>

		<p>People will readily credit this, but will ridicule
		the idea that their own imaginations are daily
		helping or hindering their own and others&#8217; lives.</p>

		<p>Marconi demonstrated that messages can be
		transmitted by wireless telegraphy, and his discovery
		became a thing of commercial value. So
		it was believed in as nothing marvellous, but
		merely as a new departure of science. Yet the
		numberless proofs of other currents beyond our
		actual sight which manifest themselves each day
		in every life, and influence it, are unconsidered
		quantities, if not actually denied.</p>

		<p>But there they are; and though, as the demonstration
		of an exact science, they are laughed to
		scorn, their force is unconsciously admitted in a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>hundred cant phrases, such as, &#8220;He was under
		an evil influence,&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;She makes you feel better
		because she is so cheerful,&#8221; etc., etc.&#8212;Both these
		things here alluded to as forces are intangible,
		and yet are real proofs of the power of imagination.</p>

		<p>This shows how tremendously important it
		is never to allow our imagination to run into
		prognostications of evil, either in predictions for
		our country, for ourselves, or for our friends.
		Each unit should try to help the great force for
		good by sending forth strong positive thoughts
		for its upliftment.</p>

		<p>Think, for a moment, under what a terrible
		shadow the soul of Christian man has lain for
		these many hundred years! Ever since the doctrine
		of original sin was forced upon his belief,
		his soul has come into the world handicapped by
		millions of thought-currents expecting it to do
		evil, unless continuously controlled and curtailed
		and punished into a semblance of good! It cannot
		be wondered at, then, that sometimes these
		forces become too strong for it, and it does fall
		into sin. But what an insult to God, the source
		of all love and beauty and holiness, to suppose
		He would permit a tarnished atom of Himself
		to reach the exquisite world He has created!</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15">&nbsp;</a>All who wish for enlightenment upon this
		subject, and as to how they should view their
		children and their race, should read Edmond
		Holmes&#8217;s masterly work upon elementary education,
		&#8220;What Is, and What Might Be.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We cannot stop the force which our own action,
		in giving education to the lowest people,
		has put in motion, and which has produced, from
		their status upward, the &#8220;Great Unrest.&#8221; We
		can hardly even hope to control it; but we can
		and must do all in our power to guide and direct
		it into channels for the good and glory of our
		dear country, making it, as the fire Prometheus
		stole from heaven, an incentive to noble actions
		and great ends.</p>

		<p>Could not the people with large influence,
		who are interested in this matter, band together
		and discuss some scheme for the sending out of
		lecturers all over England who would explain,
		with common sense entirely stripped of all politics
		or religion, to the rising generation, the vast
		importance of individual responsibility&#8212;the duty
		of all citizens&#8212;the glory of helping the great
		force aright? Explanations, in a practical and
		simple form, would do more than a thousand
		laws, or all the thunders from the pulpit or the
		platform. If the children in every school could
		<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>be made to feel they are all little men and
		women, full of God&#8217;s gift of a soul, able and
		willing to help the raising of their country, they
		would soon graft a new spirit into their homes.
		They would respond as readily as do the hundreds
		of brave men who volunteer for active
		service, and probable death, to reinforce a fire-brigade,
		or a life-boat&#8217;s crew. Children are so
		wise when their fine instincts are appealed to.</p>

		<p>If only this fundamental principle could be
		understood&#8212;that each individual has in this life,
		or some former one, attracted to himself the exact
		environment that he is now in&#8212;and that it
		lies only with himself whether he remains in it,
		or lifts himself out of it, there would be no
		more class hatred, no more railing against hard
		luck and injustice, but a steady increase of betterment
		all over the world.</p>

		<p>The unfortunate thing is, that nearly all
		writers and talkers and lecturers, who are enthusiasts,
		and therefore really believe in what
		they are preaching, have so little common sense.</p>

		<p>They carry away their readers or audiences
		for the moment upon the current of their own
		divine enthusiasm, but when their utterances
		come to be measured by the cold light of fact,
		the logical conclusions are so faulty, that the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17">&nbsp;</a>whole, which contained many thoughts of great
		and beautiful worth, is dismissed as the ravings
		of a dreamer, and ceases to have any effect.</p>

		<p>The main attribute of any religion, of any
		ethical teaching, of any principle&#8212;to be of use
		to men and women at the present stage of their
		development&#8212;<em>must</em> be incontestable common
		sense. Ridiculous sentimentality should be ruthlessly
		crushed, and investigation of the meaning
		of Nature should be strenuously encouraged.
		And with clear eyes we should try to see the
		truth. Let those born fighters who like fighting
		for fighting&#8217;s sake, and who now wage war
		against windmills, being armed with prejudice
		and false conceptions of man&#8217;s place in relation
		to God, turn their belligerent powers to the
		demolition of the double-headed Hydra, Hypocrisy
		and Deceit.</p>

		<p>It is the duty of every true man and woman at
		this hour of their country&#8217;s day to begin to
		THINK, to weigh for himself or herself the
		meanings of the signs of the times, to use their
		critical faculties, to face facts honestly, unhampered
		by prudery, convention, or the doctrines
		of the Church. And then they will see for themselves
		that the Great Unrest is a force, the direction
		of which, for good or ill, lies in their own
		<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18">&nbsp;</a>hands. And according to the way they fulfil the
		responsibility entailed upon them in this matter,
		they or their children will reap the reward, or
		pay the price. The Great Unrest in its seething
		is still molten metal, which can be poured into
		what mould we will.</p>

		<p>To call this Great Unrest a sign of decadence
		and a presage of destruction, would be as fallacious
		as to say that electricity is an entirely
		mischievous force. Both are mischievous when
		undirected, and both are glorious when used for
		good.</p>

		<p>The test of the expansion of man&#8217;s soul is the
		extent of its outlook. The puny spirit sees an
		hour or two ahead; the more advanced probably
		conceives plans to benefit himself and his loved
		ones day by day. The developed soul desires
		the good of his country. But the soul that is
		infinite and emancipated sees into eternity and
		demands of God the regeneration of humanity.</p>

			THE GOSPEL OF COMMON SENSE</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Of</span> all the attributes which we of the twentieth
		century should most strenuously
		encourage, that of common sense ranks
		first, in the face of the hysteria which threatens
		to weaken, if it does not swamp, all the wonderful
		new spirit of progress which is abroad.</p>

		<p>Common sense applied to everything alone
		can restore our equilibrium as a nation, because
		as the years of this new century go on hysteria
		seems to increase. Nothing in the way of a public
		event can happen, from the just condemnation
		of a criminal for some atrocious crime, to
		the sinking of an ocean mammoth ship, but a
		large section of the public makes an outcry inspired
		by altruism or so-called humanitarianism,
		both developing into hysteria.</p>

		<p>Let us look at the reason of this carefully, and
		we shall see that this state of things is the direct
		result of an irresponsible employment of the
		gigantic power of thought. Some few excitable
		<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>brains start an idea, the circulation of which is
		made possible by the modern facilities for expression
		in the press. And because the majority
		of readers do not think for themselves, they
		are drawn into the current of unrest which has
		thus been suggested to their imagination, each
		individual augmenting its strength until it grows
		into a torrent of folly.</p>

		<p>This proves the tremendous importance it is
		to a nation that each of its units should realise
		his own responsibility in regard to this matter.
		The moment that such a thing could be accomplished&#8212;that
		is, that the understanding of the
		power of thought could be brought home to
		people&#8212;there are millions of sound, honest folk
		who would deliberately try to use their possession
		of it for the good of themselves and the
		race, and who would bring up their children to
		do likewise.</p>

		<p>The wave of complete materialism which
		passed over Europe during what we call the
		Victorian period discouraged any personal investigation
		of forces beyond what could actually be
		proved by the senses. Numberless examples of
		natural phenomena were laughed to scorn as the
		illusions of the ignorant. People read their
		Bibles, wherein there are countless instances
		<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21">&nbsp;</a>shown of the power of thought, and never
		dreamed of applying the teaching to themselves.
		How such a materialistic age ever accepted
		Christ&#8217;s miracles is a matter for wonderment,
		although now, looked at from the point of view
		of those who have investigated the currents of
		nature, the miracles are merely a proof of Jesus&#8217;
		divine understanding of these currents and
		forces in their greatest measure. We modern
		people are only as yet at the experimental stage,
		and hedged in by timidity and custom, but there
		is no reason why we should not advance if we
		desire to do so.</p>

		<p>Think how the power of thought showed itself
		about the <i>Titanic</i> disaster! There is no
		need now to go over its hysterical effects upon
		us on land, how in our misery and anxiety
		we praised and blamed from excitable imagination,
		before any actual facts could be
		known to justify either course. But let us instead
		try to imagine what in its glorious form
		it did upon that great ship on the night of her
		overwhelming.</p>

		<p>Everything seems to have been calm and in
		fair order. Why? Because it has been now
		proved that the majority of those on board did
		not <em>think</em> the ship could sink. Only a limited
		<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22">&nbsp;</a>number of men <em>knew</em> that she not only could,
		but <em>would</em>, and these glorious and splendid souls
		did their duty to the last, with the awful knowledge
		of certain death in their hearts. Their
		names should be written in letters of gold&#8212;heroes,
		indeed! But, meanwhile, the power of
		thought had kept all calm, and had permitted
		the saving of the women and children without
		panic.</p>

		<p>Think for a moment what would have happened
		if the passengers of all classes had been
		aware, from the first moment of the collision,
		that all were bound to go down who could not
		find places in the boats. The power of thought
		would then have created a mad panic of fear
		which no officers&#8217; pistols could have kept in
		check, and which might have produced a rush
		upon the lifeboats which would have swamped
		them all. But as it was, the power of thought
		in the few individuals who realised the general
		peril, was used by them in a godlike suppression
		of their own emotion, which produced an answering
		vibration of calm in the majority under
		their care.</p>

		<p>I do not want to refer to the awful story
		except in so far as it is a concrete illustration of
		what I wish to write about&#8212;the power of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23">&nbsp;</a>thought examined with common sense in its relation
		to the happiness of each individual, and
		the responsibility of its employment by each
		individual for the benefit of the community&#8212;not
		from the desire to use this opportunity to circulate
		propaganda for any of the new ethical
		teachings, but simply from a common-sense
		point of view to see what good we can get out of
		a belief that is, I suppose, common to them
		all.</p>

		<p>Now let us consider what most of us do actually
		know about this power of thought. We all
		are aware that no picture can be painted, no machinery
		invented, before a clear vision of it has
		been realised in the creator&#8217;s brain. Not a single
		conscious action can be put into motion and force
		without its having first occurred to the imagination.
		The painter&#8217;s hand and brush would be
		of no avail undirected by his brain or mind,
		which has first mentally visualised what it wishes
		to create in fact. Draw the analogy from this,
		and you will see that what you think about must
		have an enormous bearing upon your life. If
		thought, when inspired by desire, is strong
		enough to cause the hand to reproduce the vision
		of the imagination of the artist, this is an incontestable
		proof that thought is a very strong force
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24">&nbsp;</a>indeed. You will agree with this if you&#8212;each
		individual who is reading these words&#8212;begin to
		examine yourself with truth.</p>

		<p>Admitted, then, that you perceive the force of
		thought. Now consider what miserable thinking
		is likely to bring you. It, according to the
		analogy above, can only eventually attract for
		you <em>in fact</em> the miserable conditions that you
		have dwelt upon in imagination. If, on the contrary,
		you think constantly of fine and prosperous
		things, you must by this reasoning, be connecting
		yourself with the currents which can
		bring them in their material form.</p>

		<p>Therefore, every time you say &#8220;I am ill,&#8221; or
		think &#8220;I am ill,&#8221; are you not helping the illness
		to materialise? because the power of thought,
		which you cannot deny as the initial cause of
		every action, has then been turned to aid the condition
		of ill health.</p>

		<p>Supposing for some cause you really are ill,
		why then help this evil state to augment by your
		thoughts? Rather impede its progress as far
		as you can by creating good-thought conditions.</p>

		<p>You may reply, &#8220;But I am constantly doing
		this, and yet nothing good comes.&#8221; Pause and
		use your common sense by remembering that for
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25">&nbsp;</a>twenty&#8212;thirty&#8212;forty years perhaps, when you
		did not analyse matters, you were laying up for
		yourself numberless stumbling-blocks by wrong
		thinking, which according to the law we are discussing
		must be surmounted before you can start
		on a clear road. And the reason why you do
		not immediately receive the result of your good
		thoughts is that you are still under the action of
		your bad ones. But if you recognise this law of
		the power of thought, you need not incur for
		yourself any further debts to pay.</p>

		<p>And to recognise it as a law you have only to
		use your common sense to see that it is not conceivable
		that thoughts can have no effect outside
		your own brain. They cannot be wasted and go
		into nothingness, they <em>must</em> strike some answering
		vibration somewhere, and it is surely rational
		to suppose they will strike the kindred vibration
		rather than some totally different one, as the
		Marconi messages strike the pole in tune to
		them. At least, it is worth while trying to believe
		this, because if you can it will make you
		happier.</p>

		<p>Alas! I am not a scientist who can dogmatically
		prove every fraction of my beliefs. I only
		want to awaken my readers to think for themselves
		upon this interesting subject, for the facts
		<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26">&nbsp;</a>are there for us all to investigate, unaided by
		scientists, if we will.</p>

		<p>So without any more argument, shall we take
		it for granted that you are with me thus far,
		and have seen my point? Yes. Then let us
		examine what our thoughts do for us.</p>

		<p>For example, let us suppose a man has a disease
		which is believed to be incurable. His
		thoughts tell him so constantly, and the thoughts
		of his friends, often expressed in words, convince
		him still further of his misfortune. He is
		certain nothing he can do will make it better,
		and any remedy that is applied will only meet
		with failure. He has made his mental picture
		of an incurable disease; and so he is helping the
		material result to accomplish itself. But, as hope
		springs eternal in the human breast, he still goes
		from doctor to doctor for fresh advice, while
		unconsciously nullifying the benefit he might receive
		from doing so by his attitude of mind in
		holding the belief that nothing can cure him.
		We must all of us know of cases like this, and
		have seen the gradual increase in the person&#8217;s
		illness.</p>

		<p>Now supposing that the starting-point is the
		same; the disease certainly is there, but the man
		is determined not to aid and augment this state
		<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27">&nbsp;</a>of things, so whenever the thought presents itself
		that he has an incurable disease he persistently
		banishes it and replaces it with one that
		he will grow well. He will be aiding that condition;
		he will be making himself the pole in
		tune to receive the answering vibrations of his
		mental picture. He will know that he must be
		drawing to himself every chance that science has
		up till this time of the world&#8217;s day been able to
		invent or discover for the betterment of such a
		disease as his. He will know that he is giving
		nature a free hand, and as far as he is able, he
		is opening every door to the probability that he
		may grow well. Now, if we admit the power
		of thought, we must admit it has power to go
		both these ways. Is it not worth while trying
		to think good things for ourselves, then, instead
		of evil ones?</p>

		<p>It does not seem possible, as I understand
		some assert, that by mere thinking and believing
		we can cure even a broken arm. Because, although
		the principle may be right in its eventuality,
		no one on earth can be quite advanced
		enough yet to draw these forces to himself sufficiently
		strongly to demonstrate it as Christ did.
		But we are at the stage when, by our thoughts,
		we can certainly aid physical means of betterment.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28">&nbsp;</a>Thus when we or our friends are ill, it
		lies in our own hands whether we will aid or retard
		our or their recovery.</p>

		<p>Long years ago, before any of these psychic
		waves were discussed or given the least credence,
		I remember a very celebrated American doctor
		telling me, as a curious fact, that he often got
		his patients over the crisis of typhoid fever by
		telling them cheerfully beforehand that the dangerous
		moment was passed, and they were not to
		worry over the seemingly worse physical sensations
		they were perhaps about to experience&#8212;these
		were only the reaction. In that way, he
		said, he removed the amount of fear from the
		mind of the patient which otherwise might have
		been enough to cause the extra exertion to the
		heart which would have proved fatal at the critical
		moment. The power of thought, you see,
		and nothing else, then saved them.</p>

		<p>To continue this line of reasoning in mental,
		not physical, things. Supposing you feel angry
		and resentful towards some one, and you send
		out thoughts of hate and ill-will. The pole in
		tune to such feelings in that person will answer
		and return them to you, and a condition of evil
		will be created. But supposing that, when perhaps
		the justly angry and resentful thoughts present
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29">&nbsp;</a>themselves, you replace them instantly with
		kind and loving ones. You will have disconnected
		yourself with the evil thoughts of the
		other person, they can no longer reach you, and
		if he has any good in him you will have connected
		yourself with that good, and so peace can
		be established.</p>

		<p>All this is common sense, which is the only attitude
		of mind with which to approach any new
		suggestion that we may get benefit from it, and
		not through our arrogant ignorance dismiss it
		as nonsense, until we have proved it to be such.
		A hundred years ago the telephone would have
		been considered either as magic or the vapourings
		of a madman if an individual had tried to
		explain it. We say that &#8220;France is developing
		a new spirit,&#8221; we say &#8220;A wave of discontent
		seems to be passing over such and such a community,&#8221;
		we are thus unconsciously admitting
		the power of forces beyond the perceptible.
		Why cannot we instantly grasp, then, what the
		power of our everyday thought is doing for us,
		and how careful we should be in its direction to
		avoid augmenting the current of foolish and
		harmful ones&#8212;because unity is strength. There
		are many grains of good to be got out of all
		new ethical teachings, if only they can be sifted
		<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30">&nbsp;</a>by common sense. The unfortunate part is, that
		very often it is only the faddists who expound
		them, and they go off at a tangent. One reads
		several pages of illuminating matter, and then,
		perhaps, one comes upon a chapter devoted to
		proving that mankind must train itself to live
		upon nuts or uncooked vegetables! Or that the
		only way to learn concentration is for the pupil
		to school himself mentally to stare for so many
		minutes at an imaginary spot in the solar plexus!</p>

		<p>Common sense revolts, although many may
		not be sufficiently trained to make the deduction
		that if God, the omnipotent, original, all-dominating
		dynamo, gave the flesh of bird, beast and
		fish, and the fruits and vegetables of the earth
		for mankind to feed upon, it is a little ridiculous
		for one sect to eliminate as food all but the
		special part of these aliments of which it approves.
		Thus, common sense being affronted,
		all the rest of the teaching is likely to fall upon
		stony ground and only be received by the faddists
		in tune to this particular argument. No
		theory for the betterment of mankind will succeed
		now with the mass of people or make any
		lasting mark upon time unless its basic principle
		can stand practical dissection.</p>

		<p>So that upon this subject of the power of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31">&nbsp;</a>thought, all that any one at the present stage
		can do, no matter what his own personal beliefs
		may be, is to try and awaken people to think
		about it themselves and make their own investigations;
		to open a window for any soul to look
		through and see what he can get from it for himself.
		Because, as yet, the scientists and psychologists
		have not been sufficiently interested in the
		idea to endeavour to prove and demonstrate it
		as an exact science beyond all controversy.
		When this has been done, the intelligent will
		credit it because they are convinced, and the ignorant
		because they follow the others without
		reason.</p>

		<p>All I hope to do by writing this article is to
		point out that the power of thought is a vital
		factor in our lives, and can really affect every
		hour of them for good or ill.</p>

		<p>Thousands of people who read the new ethical
		or religious books which are abroad, and even
		exploit their propaganda&#8212;thousands who attend
		the various meetings and services and lectures
		of the different societies, be they &#8220;New
		Thought&#8221; or any of the others on more or less
		the same lines&#8212;never dream of applying the
		teachings to a single ordinary thing, and still go
		on with their tempers and melancholy and flurry
		<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>and fuss, just as they did before they ever heard
		of the idea that they can control and eliminate
		these things. An enormous majority of the public
		are frightened at the very name of a new religion
		or ethical teaching, and think it wrong
		even to investigate what it teaches. But the
		broad-minded are unafraid of any knowledge,
		and can gain good by knowing about all developments
		of human thought, provided they approach
		each point with common sense and without
		hysteria, dismissing the idea of what we are
		accustomed to call the supernatural, and realising
		that everything has a perfectly natural explanation
		when it can be understood, and it is
		only our ignorance which makes us shy at it.</p>

		<p>And so I would appeal to those who credit
		this power of thought to employ it responsibly,
		and to realise that they are all God&#8217;s atoms in
		the great scheme of things, and must use their
		personal force as a contribution to the vast
		thought-waves which can advance, or which,
		when ill directed, can sweep away a nation.</p>

			MARRIAGE</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> is an interesting subject&#8212;and one which
		has touched, or will probably touch, most
		of our lives, therefore it may not be unprofitable
		to study it a little, and what it means
		and what it should mean; because, in the present
		upheaval of all our old beliefs, marriage, as a
		sensible institution, is being attacked upon many
		sides.</p>

		<p>It is extremely easy to pull down a house, but
		it requires skill and special training to rebuild
		it again; and before dragging the roof off and
		demolishing the walls, it would be wiser to have
		made a distinct plan and provided the materials
		ready for the reconstruction of a new habitation,
		that the rain and the wind may not overcome
		us when we have no shelter for our heads. But
		this is what the attackers of marriage have failed
		to do as yet. Here are three facts which we can
		begin by looking at.</p>

		<p><em>Firstly.</em> Some kind of union between man
		<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34">&nbsp;</a>and woman, consolidated by the law, is necessary
		for the continuation of a race in vigour and
		moral upliftment.</p>

		<p><em>Secondly.</em> It is admitted by great philosophers
		and deep thinkers that the welfare of the
		community is of more importance than the fluctuating
		desires of the individual.</p>

		<p><em>Thirdly.</em> A fine ideal, however impossible
		of attainment, is a force for good to be held up
		before the eyes of the mass of the people, who,
		however much actual education has advanced,
		are still too unendowed with personal brain to
		have any judgment themselves&#8212;their capacities
		only allowing them to see the effects of things
		upon their immediate surroundings without perceiving
		the causes, and therefore leaving them
		incapable of judging what could be good for
		the country, the race, or humanity in general.</p>

		<p>After all these centuries, legal marriage still
		holds, because no one has been able to suggest
		any other union which could take its place without
		bringing chaos. And it seems more than
		likely that no one will ever be sufficiently inspired
		so to do! Thus let us now consider the
		present legal marriage as still being a stable
		fact, and see how we can make the best of it.
		In it there are two things which both man and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35">&nbsp;</a>woman forget&#8212;or refuse to face&#8212;and which
		are perhaps the chief causes of most unhappiness.
		Man forgets that his kind <em>words</em> of love
		and sympathy matter far more to the actual
		happiness of the woman than any of his <em>deeds</em>:
		because words fill and satisfy her imagination,
		which is active whenever she is alone; and kind
		deeds, with few or indifferent words, make very
		little impression upon it. Woman forgets&#8212;or
		will not face&#8212;the fact that man is by nature a
		polygamous animal. There is no use in arguing
		about this and saying he ought not to be, and
		that it is a horrible idea. It is a physiological
		fact, and to dispute it is to criticise the Almighty&#8217;s
		scheme for ensuring a continued population.
		That man should have polygamous instincts is
		essential for this scheme to work against any
		odds.</p>

		<p>Whatever we choose to say in contradiction
		to this resolves itself into empty words, the fact
		of nature remaining. It would be just as sensible
		to try to argue that, because we do not like
		to drink sea water, it has no business to be salt!
		and to decide that it is <em>not</em> salt! and that we will
		not recognise that <em>it is</em> salt! The ocean would
		just laugh at us, and remain briny! And no
		doubt Nature laughs at silly woman too, when
		<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>she tries to judge man without understanding
		the elementary principle of creation.</p>

		<p>This being grasped clearly, it must be seen
		that monogamous marriage is <em>an ideal state</em>, not
		a <em>natural state</em>, and it must be admitted to be
		such, and lived up to as an ideal, not undertaken
		with the notion that fidelity in man is <em>natural</em>,
		and infidelity an <em>unnatural</em> thing. It is the other
		way about because of the fundamental instincts
		of man, which continuously and subconsciously
		suggest to him the necessity for self-preservation,
		and in its larger sense self-preservation
		means species-preservation.</p>

		<p>Woman, on the other hand, although unconsciously
		inspired by this same fundamental instinct
		of species-preservation, is not naturally
		polygamous, or rather polyandrous, because such
		a state would militate against this end by eventually
		destroying pure offspring. She only becomes
		so under certain conditions. Fidelity,
		then, is, so to speak, a natural state for woman,
		and she has not to fight against any fundamental
		instinct of her sex in order to preserve it&#8212;she
		has only to resist perverted desire, which is an
		exotic growth, the outcome of civilisation. Thus
		fidelity is much harder for man, who, to succeed
		in being faithful, is obliged to dominate a natural
		<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>instinct, which is a far more difficult thing to
		do than to fight against an exotic desire; because
		all natural things are governed by inexorable
		and eternal laws, and are not at the mercy
		of circumstance. Thus the natural instinct of
		man is at work all the time in continuous activity&#8212;and
		the exotic desire of woman is intermittent,
		and the result of circumstance.</p>

		<p>Of course, all this has been said before by
		every serious thinker, and I am only reiterating
		these facts because the general readers may have
		forgotten them, and I must bring them to their
		recollection to make the rest of our discussion
		upon marriage clear.</p>

		<p>These nature instincts being admitted, we can
		get on to a survey of legal marriage. At first,
		it must have been an affair of expediency. The
		woman was probably expected to be faithful, and
		brute force took care that she was so, or that
		she immediately paid the price of possible contamination
		of offspring by being killed. She
		was expected to be faithful for a natural reason,
		not for a spiritual or sentimental one; the reason
		being, as already inferred, to ensure the purity
		of the offspring. Man had no need to be faithful
		to one woman to secure this end, and never,
		in consequence, dreamed of being so.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38">&nbsp;</a>All through Pagan times infidelity in man was
		rampant and recognised, and not looked upon
		as sin. And when woman became civilised
		enough to have exotic desires, she lost her natural
		instinct, that of preservation of pure offspring,
		and became liable to vagrant fancies and
		often a vicious creature.</p>

		<p>Then the Church arrived and turned marriage
		into a sacrament; presumably with the
		noble intention of trying to elevate man and
		overcome his carnal nature. Man outwardly
		conformed, and, with his whole soul&#8217;s desire to
		be true and to uplift himself, each individual
		who really believed no doubt did war with his
		instincts, and numbers probably succeeded in
		conquering them. While woman, always a creature
		of more delicate nervous susceptibilities,
		flung herself with furore under the influences
		of spiritual things, and in the truly devout cases
		overcame her grafted desires and returned to
		natural instincts. But in beings of both sexes
		who were unconvinced by religion, infidelity
		continued to flourish, as it does even to this day.
		A man who truly believes that he is sinning in
		being unfaithful, and who understands that
		outside opinion is nothing in the soiling of his
		own soul, but that the matter is between himself
		<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39">&nbsp;</a>and God, will always be faithful <em>in body</em>
		to a woman he has wedded, whether he cares
		for her or not. But a man who has not this conviction,
		and who does not live in this intimate
		relation to God, has no reason to hold him from
		indulging his natural instinct, except the fear
		of being found out, and when his sagacity has
		suggested safeguards against this, his instinct
		will certainly give itself expression. It is all
		a question of personal belief. There are numbers
		of good and honest characters who do not
		feel convinced that entire fidelity in man to one
		woman was intended by the Creator, and who
		therefore feel no degradation in the latitude
		they allow themselves. It is not for us to argue
		which are right and which are wrong, but to
		stick to the subject of marriage and how it can
		perhaps be made happier in these present days,
		when all other conditions of life are changing,
		by a better comprehension of fundamental instincts
		and laws of nature.</p>

		<p>Woman has developed so far that generally
		she thinks she is (and sometimes she really is!)
		a reasonable and balanced creature, with strong
		individuality&#8212;and personal tastes and likes
		and dislikes. She is now ill-fitted to keep them
		all in subservience to man, unless he is her intellectual
		<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>master. She may have wedded only
		because the emotion of sex (not understood as
		such, and called by a number of other names
		such as &#8220;love,&#8221; &#8220;devotion,&#8221; &#8220;attraction&#8221;)
		forced her at one of its powerful moments to
		take a physical mate&#8212;totally unsuited to her
		moral calibre. But she has knelt at the altar
		and sworn vows before God&#8212;and perhaps has
		fulfilled woman&#8217;s original mission in the world,
		and become the mother of children&#8212;so what is
		to be done to rectify her mistake and its unhappy
		consequences?</p>

		<p>She must look the whole circumstances of it
		in the face and ask herself whether she herself
		threw dust in her own eyes as regards the character
		of her husband, whether he deceived her
		in this, or whether they just drifted together,
		each to blame as much as the other, through the
		attraction of sex and the cruelty of ignorance.
		She may regret it a thousandfold&#8212;but she has
		done the thing of her own free will, no one
		forced her to wed the man; she may have done
		so unwillingly in some cases&#8212;and for ulterior
		motives, but at all events she was consenting
		and not dragged to church resisting, and so if
		she is sensible she will use the whole of her
		intelligence to make the best of it. She will
		<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>look to the end of her every action and her
		every thought. Will brooding over her
		&#8220;rights,&#8221; and the wrongs he has inflicted, mend
		them? Will it do anything but give her vanity&#8212;the
		satisfaction of self-pity? Certainly not.</p>

		<p>If she has really evolved enough to wish to
		impose her opinions and individuality upon her
		household or the community, she will have realised
		that the welfare of the home for which she
		is responsible, and the community to which she
		belongs, are, or ought to be, of far more consequence
		to her than her own personal emotions.
		Therefore she must ask herself whether she has
		any right to upset the happiness of the one, and
		the conception of good of the other, by indulging
		in personal quarrels and bickerings, or open
		scandal with her mate. A really noble and unselfish
		woman would never consider her personal
		emotion before her duty to God and to her
		neighbour. It is because the outlook of woman
		is as a rule so pitifully narrow and self-centred
		that she often makes a useless and unhappy wife,
		and shipwrecks her own and others&#8217; futures.</p>

		<p>Man has gone on with his brute force, and his
		physical and mental attraction, and his tastes
		and beliefs and aspirations very much the same
		for thousands of years. Numbers of them were
		<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>brutes then, and numbers are brutes still and will
		remain so. It is only woman who has so incredibly
		changed, and after staying immeasurably
		behind in importance and in intellectuality
		for countless centuries, now seeks to equal if not
		outstep man in all things. It would be well for
		man to wake up to the fact that he is now wedding
		a woman with every sense and nerve and
		conception of life far in advance of what his
		mother believed herself to be capable of&#8212;and
		so his methods towards her in return must not
		be as his father&#8217;s were. If man wishes to have
		the good, domestic, obedient wife his father&#8212;perhaps
		one should go farther back and say
		grandfather!&#8212;expected&#8212;and got&#8212;he must
		either choose a timid weakling who becomes
		just his echo, or he must learn to treat the
		modern woman as a comrade, a being who mentally
		can understand and follow his aspirations
		and even assist him in his desires, a creature to
		respect and consult, and whom he cannot rule
		just because he is a man and she is a woman&#8212;but
		can only do so, and bring her to obedience,
		when he has shown her his intellectual superiority
		and his wisdom.</p>

		<p>Woman is as willing to be ruled as ever she
		was&#8212;she always adores a master; but she has
		<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43">&nbsp;</a>grown too intelligent to bow her head just because
		a man is a <em>man</em>&#8212;he must be <em>the man</em>.
		Man is naturally fighting for his old omnipotence,
		which he possessed regardless of his personal
		endowment, simply because he was a male
		creature&#8212;and the foolish section of woman is
		fighting man, with bombs and tricks and frantic
		words, instead of <em>convincing</em> him by her wisdom
		and attainments, by her demonstrations of
		knowledge of life and its duties and responsibilities,
		that she has grown at last indeed fitted
		to be treated as an equal and a comrade, not as
		a plaything and a slave.</p>

		<p>Who does not respect a woman who fulfils
		all her obligations with grace and charm, whose
		house is well ordered, whose friends are well
		entertained by her fine mind, and whose children
		are well brought up and full of understanding?
		She is indeed more precious than rubies and far
		more full of influence for the good of her community
		than she who shouts of rights and
		wrongs and votes and such-like. The first woman
		could control a hundred votes, and help a
		government, but the second can only clog the
		wheels of the sex&#8217;s advancement.</p>

		<p>Now we get back to marriage!</p>

		<p>And the first and foremost thing to be understood
		<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44">&nbsp;</a>is that it is a frightful responsibility to
		undertake, and that all those who enter into this
		bond lightly and for frivolous motives, or from
		just drifting, will be made by fate to pay the
		price.</p>

		<p>Think of it! Two people stand up and swear
		before God to continue to love one another until
		death do them part. They solemnly stand there
		and make vows about an emotion over which
		they have no more control than they have over
		the keeping of the wind in the south. They
		have only control, if they have strong wills, over
		its demonstration. And then in nine cases out
		of ten neither thinks for a moment afterwards,
		of his or her responsibility <em>of trying to make
		possible</em> the observance of these vows, by keeping
		alight the flame of love in the other&#8217;s heart.
		A man utterly disillusions a woman and then
		blames her, not himself, for her ceasing to care
		for him, and being eventually attracted by some
		one else! A woman disgusts or bores a man,
		and then bewails her sad lot, and calls the man
		a brute for being indifferent, and a shameful
		creature for looking elsewhere for consolation!
		In all marriages there is no one to blame or
		praise for unhappiness or happiness but the two
		individuals themselves. It is his fault&#8212;or misfortune&#8212;if
		<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45">&nbsp;</a>she no longer cares, and likewise
		hers in the parallel case&#8212;and it is owing to the
		weakness of either if outside circumstances have
		been able to interfere. Thus to ensure happiness
		there must be a tremendous sense of personal
		responsibility, and there should be understanding
		of life and understanding of nature instincts
		and understanding of sex instincts; and a
		ruthless tearing away of the false values which
		a Victorian age grafted upon religion, narrowing
		the mind of woman as to man&#8217;s needs&#8212;and
		narrowing man&#8217;s conception of woman&#8217;s mental
		capacity.</p>

		<p>No woman must ever forget in her relation
		to man that &#8220;he who pays the piper calls the
		tune,&#8221; and in this I am not only speaking literally
		of shekels of gold and silver, but of the
		power incorporated in certain personalities; and
		man, if he chose to exert it, has always <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">force
		majeure</em> at his command in the last extremity,
		although in these days of Herculean young
		women he may lose even this in time!</p>

		<p>Before undertaking to play that most difficult
		part of wife, every girl ought to ask herself,
		Does she really care for the man enough to
		make her use her intelligence to understand
		him, and to try to keep him loving her? Or if
		<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>she does not personally care enough for him to
		trouble about this&#8212;will the situation of her husband
		in the world satisfy her, and make the
		bondage, unleavened by love, of the care of
		house, servants, and possible children, worth
		while?</p>

		<p>Before undertaking the situation she ought
		to look at every aspect of the case, and question
		herself searchingly upon her own aims and ends,
		and if the actual facts will or will not fit in with
		them. Having made up her mind that for one
		reason or another it is for her happiness to take
		a certain man for her mate, she ought then sedulously
		to cultivate all the aspects of the condition
		which can conduce to peace and to the
		attainment and enjoyment of that end. She
		must not forget that the man has paid her the
		highest honour a man can pay a woman. He
		has selected her to be his life&#8217;s companion. He
		proposes in nine cases out of ten, to provide
		her with a home and a position in life, and
		to take upon himself the responsibility of her
		maintenance (when the woman has money of
		her own this question is different naturally).
		But in all cases the man in asking her to marry
		him has shown that something in her&#8212;or in
		her possessions&#8212;makes her appear worth the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47">&nbsp;</a>giving up of his liberty. So she owes him
		just as much as the thing he took her for. If
		for her money, and she knows it is for that,
		and she has been sufficiently humble to accept
		him on those terms&#8212;she owes him money.
		If for love&#8212;she owes him at least the outside
		observances of love. If he has pretended love
		and it is for some other motive, his Nemesis
		will fall upon himself in the disillusion and contempt
		he will inspire. But in all cases the woman,
		through want of intelligence or pure misfortune,
		has crossed the Rubicon with him; she
		has allowed him to teach her the meaning of
		dual life&#8212;she has put it into his power with her
		to create future lives. She cannot, for any
		price or any prayers, recross that fatal stream.
		So for all reasons of common sense&#8212;and
		above all, sense of responsibility to the community&#8212;she
		had better make the best of her
		bargain.</p>

		<p>Likewise, man should pause and think, Is it
		merely because I cannot obtain this woman upon
		any other terms that I am offering her marriage?
		Have I respect for her? Do I think she
		will bring happiness into my house as well as
		pleasure to my body? Is she suited to my brain
		capacity when I am not exalted by physical emotion?
		<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48">&nbsp;</a>Am I going to curb my selfishness and behave
		decently towards her?</p>

		<p>If he cannot answer these questions satisfactorily
		he may know that he is undertaking a hundred-to-one
		chance of peace and happiness. But
		if the physical desire is stronger than all these
		considerations, then he must <em>know and realise</em>
		that whatever happens <em>he must never blame the
		woman</em>. He has succumbed to the most material
		and alas! the most hideously strong force
		in nature&#8212;not because the woman tempted him,
		as it has been the fashion for man to say since
		the days of Adam&#8212;but because there is something
		in himself which is so weak that it cannot
		listen to the promptings of the spirit when the
		body calls.</p>

		<p>In each and every case it is a man&#8217;s duty to be
		kind and courteous to a woman who is his wife.
		He has made her so by his free vows before God
		(because no one can be forced to the altar
		against his absolute will in these days), or he
		has made her so by vows and business agreement,
		according to the laws of his country, before
		the Registrar. In either case he has made
		her his legal wife and the possible mother of his
		children&#8212;units unborn who can affect the welfare
		of his country. He has, then, his great
		<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49">&nbsp;</a>duties towards her. If she was a girl, he has
		taken from her that which nothing on earth can
		restore; he has made her into another being.
		He has been instrumental in making her&#8212;this
		other human soul&#8212;accept responsibilities, and
		he is bound as an honourable man to school himself
		so as to be able to help the mutual happiness
		and peace of their dual existence. And if he
		wishes to be obeyed, loved, and respected, he
		has to look to himself that he inspires obedience,
		love, and respect in his mate. She will not
		experience these feelings to order; and fear
		alone, or some other and lower motive, would
		make her simulate them. Man must not forget
		that nothing simulated can last. Truth alone
		remains at the end of the year.</p>

		<p>No marriage can be certain of continuing
		happy which has been entered into in the spirit
		of taking a lottery ticket. But most marriages
		could be fairly happy if both man and woman
		looked the thing squarely in the face and made
		up their minds that they would run together in
		harness as two well-trained carriage horses, both
		knowing of the pole, both pulling at the collar
		and not over-straining the traces, both taking
		pride in their high stepping and their unity
		of movement. How much more dignified than
		<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>to make a pitiful exhibition of incompatibility
		like two wild creatures kicking and plunging,
		and finally upsetting the vehicle they had agreed
		to draw?</p>

		<p>I would like to discuss now the problem of
		whether or not marriage could be made happy
		no matter how it starts, by using common sense,
		but the deep interest of the whole subject has
		made my pen already cover too much space and
		I must refrain in this chapter.</p>

		<p>Only, men and women who read this, do not
		pass it by, but stop and <em>think</em> before you plunge,
		through the giving and the taking of a wedding
		ring, into happiness or misery.</p>

			AFTER MARRIAGE</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Considering</span> the instability of all our
		tastes and desires and the almost total
		want of personal discipline which prevails
		in the present day, it is really remarkable
		that the legal marriage goes on even as well as
		it does!&#8212;but that the state could be much happier
		is patent to any understanding, and it may
		be interesting to look at one or two aspects of
		it, and see from whence comes the discord. A
		woman enters into matrimony for various reasons,
		but, in the majority of cases in England
		and America at least, it is because she is, or fancies
		she is, in love with the man at the time. He,
		therefore, if this is so, starts with an enormous
		power over her, which, if he chooses to keep it,
		will enable him to turn their future life in any
		way he will, because the greatest desire even of
		the most strong-minded and domineering woman
		when in love is to please the man. A woman
		only becomes indifferent as to whether or no she
		<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>is doing this when she no longer cares. Therefore,
		it is the man&#8217;s business to keep her in this
		state if he wants his home to be happy. The
		first thing for him to realise is that she cannot
		remain in love with him by her own will, any
		more than she can cease to love him by her own
		will&#8212;these states are produced in her by something
		in himself. And if he discontinues using
		the arts and attractions which awakened her love,
		he cannot expect it to continue its demonstration,
		any more than a kettle will go on boiling if the
		heat beneath is removed from it. This argument,
		of course, applies to both sexes. Unfortunately,
		in a great many cases of marriage, the
		simple attraction of sex has been the unconscious
		motive which has caused the man to enter the
		bond, and naturally, when he has gained his
		wishes he ceases to endeavour consciously to attract
		the woman. And then one of two things
		happens; either she grows to love him more for
		a time, because of that contrariness in human beings
		which always puts abnormal value upon the
		thing which is slipping out of reach&#8212;or she herself
		becomes indifferent; and then it is a mere
		chance if they both, or either of them, possess
		character and a sense of duty as to how the marriage
		goes along. We will take the case of a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>union when both parties are in love when they
		start, and really desire that their marriage should
		remain happy. Each ought to decide that he or
		she will do his or her uttermost to continue to
		put forth those charms which enchanted the
		mate before the ceremony. No one would expect
		the bloom to remain upon grapes if he carelessly
		rubbed it off, but both man and woman are
		extraordinarily surprised and disgusted when
		they find their partners are no longer in love with
		them, and at once blame them for fickleness, instead
		of examining themselves to see what
		caused this ceasing to care&#8212;what they did&#8212;or
		omitted to do&#8212;which made themselves no longer
		able to call forth love from their mates.
		And until it can be grasped that all emotion of
		love is produced by something consciously or unconsciously
		possessed by the other person&#8212;and
		that it is not in the power of the individual to
		order himself to feel it, or not to feel it, but
		that only the demonstration of the state is in his
		power&#8212;unions will go on with mutual recriminations
		and the hitting of the heads against a
		stone wall.</p>

		<p>Some natures are naturally fickle and unstable&#8212;and
		no matter how good and sweet the partner
		may be, they break away. These cases are
		<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>misfortunes, but in analysing the facts the actual
		responsibility cannot be laid at the doors of such
		people, since they could not <em>by will</em> have kept
		the sensation of love for their partners, any
		more than by will they could have ceased to care
		for them. They could only <em>by will</em> have been
		able to control the expression of their feelings.
		I seem to be reiterating this point to the verge
		of tiresomeness, but it is so vitally important
		to understand, because its non-comprehension
		produces such injustice. If John <em>by his will</em>
		were able to make himself remain in love with
		Mary, and failed to do so, then she might have
		a right to blame him because he had sworn that
		he would at the altar. But as he cannot command
		his actual emotion, she can only blame
		him for infidelity of the body, since of that, at
		least, it is possible he could be master. But,
		alas! Mary very seldom realises this, and reproaches
		John for ceasing <em>to feel loving</em> towards
		her! which is as sensible on her part as to reproach
		him for the skies pouring rain. John,
		on his side, in like case does the same thing, because
		he also has not understood the truth. A
		valuable point for both to keep in remembrance
		is that the attraction of sex is the basis of all
		&#8220;being in love.&#8221; However ennobled the emotion
		<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>may become afterwards, it always starts
		with that. (This fact is explained and elaborated
		in the conversation between the Russian
		and the Clergyman in my story, &#8220;The Point of
		View.&#8221;) If common sense is used in thinking
		about this matter, it will be seen that if this was
		not the foundation of &#8220;being in love&#8221; the emotion
		would be calm, and like that of brother and
		sister. So, admitting that this is the foundation,
		it can be understood how important a part it
		plays in the happiness of two people bound together
		by law for life, and how important it is
		to the woman to endeavor to continue to make
		herself lovable in the eyes of the man&#8212;and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
		versa</em>&#8212;<em>it is of supreme importance to whichever
		of them cares the most</em>. When the thing starts
		equally, the man nearly always cools the soonest,
		because of his fundamental instincts, and the
		force of satiation. He then probably goes on
		liking his wife&#8212;perhaps he admires and respects
		her intellect, but the thrill which used to come
		when her hand even touched his hand is no longer
		there, and he only feels emotion towards her
		<em>when he is in the mood, which would make him
		feel it towards any woman</em> who happened to be
		there at the moment. And just in the measure
		that he was passionate towards his wife, so he
		<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>will be the easy or difficult prey of a new emotion.
		And if this aspect of the case distresses the woman,
		she must look to her guns&#8212;so to speak&#8212;and
		use the whole of her intelligence to regain her
		hold over his affection. She will not improve
		matters by lamenting or reproaching the man.
		If it does not distress her, then she can congratulate
		herself that a time of peace has come!</p>

		<p>A woman must face the fact that man is a
		totally different creature from herself, governed
		by other instincts, which can be best explained
		by realising them in animals in their boldest
		nature aspect, <i>i.e.</i> a male dog at times will tear
		down any barrier that is within his personal
		strength to enable him to get to his mate, and a
		female dog will fight through unheard-of obstacles
		to reach her puppies. Here is a plain
		illustration of the different ruling original instincts
		in animals, and human beings are only the
		highest form of animal, given by God a more
		developed soul and a choice of action, but still
		influenced by fundamental nature instincts,
		which, beneath all the training of civilisation,
		unconsciously still direct their actions and affect
		their point of view. Civilisation, on its good
		side, teaches man to overcome his bodily desires
		and to keep them in check, but not to eliminate
		<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>them, to do which would militate against the
		Creator&#8217;s scheme of things. Civilisation on its
		evil side has frequently perverted woman&#8217;s natural
		instinct, so that in numbers of cases the wonderful
		devotion of the animal to her young has
		become numb in her, or dead. If only all women
		would bravely face these facts of nature instincts
		in themselves and in men, they would approach
		marriage with much broader-minded views, and
		would have a much greater chance of happiness,
		because they would realise that they must be
		lenient to man in the matter of his fidelity to
		them; and if man realised these instincts, he
		would enter marriage knowing he must make a
		fight with nature to keep the vows he has sworn,
		and so he would be on his guard against the
		first inclination to stray, instead of an easy prey
		to it. For, as it is, there is a recognised unwritten
		law among most men that honour must always
		be kept with &#8220;the other woman,&#8221; but that it is
		not necessary with a wife. A man&#8217;s honour towards
		a woman is only certain of holding with
		his inclinations&#8212;that is: A married to B will be
		unfaithful to her with C&#8212;which is technically
		dishonour. He will not consider that, but will
		tell any lie to protect C and stick to her, because
		his sense of honour has gone with his inclination.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58">&nbsp;</a>He feels he must &#8220;never give away C to B,&#8221;
		although he experiences no qualm in having
		already tacitly &#8220;given away&#8221; B to C, by his
		very part of taking C for his mistress. B is
		also a woman, but only his wife! He has not
		been the least aware of it, but his sense of honour
		has followed his inclination, in a way it would
		never do over a business arrangement with
		another man. To give a parallel case in a business
		arrangement: A makes a bargain with B that
		he will deal with him alone; he then finds he likes
		the goods of C better than those of B&#8212;but no
		honest tradesman would think of breaking his
		contract even secretly with B and dealing with
		C, for, if he did, he would know himself that
		he was dishonest, and that all his fellows who
		knew he had done this thing would despise and
		ostracise him. But a man when deceiving his
		wife not only generally feels no shame himself,
		but knows his male friends will probably not
		think the worse of him for it. There is not the
		slightest use in arguing about these facts, any
		more than, as I said in my first paper upon marriage,
		there is in arguing about fundamental instincts,
		and it would be well for women to realise
		this elastic, unwritten law of honour in
		men towards them, and so not expect, at the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59">&nbsp;</a>present state of man&#8217;s evolution, that they will
		receive anything different. They must never forget
		that this adjustable sense of honour springs
		from the same fundamental male instinct we
		spoke of&#8212;and therefore cannot be turned round
		by women and applied to their own cases, because
		the same instincts do not come into force
		with them. Woman must always remember that
		<em>man is conquering primitive nature in being
		faithful to her at all</em>, and therefore she ought,
		if she desires that he shall be so, to look to her
		own every point of attraction to make it possible
		(if not easy!) for him to fulfil her desire. I must
		reiterate again that it is wiser to remember that
		it is civilisation alone (civilisation embracing
		development of moral sense, and religious sense,
		and the force of custom) which keeps him from
		straying whenever he feels inclined, and that all
		she can do to prevent it is to redouble her own
		attractions, and to help the women of the future
		by instilling into her own sons&#8217; minds the idea
		that, as marriage is <em>an ideal and not a natural
		state</em>, the man who enters into it must be prepared
		to school himself to live up to an ideal,
		and control his vagrant emotions. To teach the
		boys a new and higher sense of honour is the
		only possible way to alter matters, as a grown
		<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60">&nbsp;</a>man is seldom changed. In marriage, both
		partners must understand that they are undertaking
		to do a most difficult thing in vowing to
		live together and love for ever! Whichever
		cares the most will have to use <em>intelligence</em> to
		keep the other&#8212;and if it is the woman who is
		unfortunate enough to occupy this position, she
		generally absolutely sacrifices herself to gratify
		the man&#8217;s smallest wish, and so makes herself
		cheap. She should use her wits and keep a firm
		hand over herself so as not to let herself become
		in his eyes of no importance.</p>

		<p>Selfishness is another basic instinct of man,
		caused because he was originally and unquestionably
		Lord of Creation, and only in the
		countries where men are in the majority
		are the greater number of them unselfish even
		now to woman. In England, where women are
		in the majority, selfishness in every male child
		is fostered from his cradle. So women must
		not indiscriminately condemn every man as
		being selfish, as though it was his personal
		fault; they must look to the cause, and condemn
		that if they want to, or, better still, try to eradicate
		it in the future by influencing their own
		sons to desire to be chivalrous and unselfish to
		the woman of the next generation. In this way
		<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61">&nbsp;</a>they would help to raise the standard of honour
		and responsibility in humanity in general.</p>

		<p>The most selfish man is not often selfish to
		the woman whom he is in love with. While she
		excites these emotions, however he shows his
		cloven hoof to the rest of the household, he will
		not show it to her. And even when he ceases to
		be in love, if his wife has filled him with respect
		and admiration for her, he will hardly dare to
		exhibit his bad qualities. You will see a man
		with the most odious character showing only the
		nicest ways to some particular person, when he
		wishes to stand well with that person. Therefore,
		to deal successfully with a selfish man, it
		ought to be obvious to a woman that the only
		effectual method to employ is to seek to create
		in his mind <em>the desire to please her</em>. If only men
		could understand that to be kind and courteous
		to their wives in the home would give them
		much greater liberty abroad, they would greatly
		add to the happiness of most marriages. It is
		her daily life which matters to a woman, because,
		as a rule, her brain is not developed enough to
		be looking ahead to the great questions of the
		day; and to have joy in her home is her earthly
		paradise.</p>

		<p>Nearly all love marriages begin with too
		<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62">&nbsp;</a>much emotion and too little self-control, and so
		become shipwrecked upon the rocks of satiety
		and indifference. Young people undertake the
		most risky experiment in the world as lightly
		and unpreparedly as they would go on a summer
		holiday!</p>

		<p>It must be understood that all these arguments
		are used from the standpoint of supposing
		the married pair start with love. When
		they do not, but are entering into a marriage
		simply from expediency, their minds are generally
		calm, they have no illusions, and are therefore
		free to use that judgment which they would
		employ over any business affair of their lives,
		and often, therefore, they get along very well.
		But these cannot be considered as ideal marriages,
		or likely to produce highly endowed
		children. And in England, at least, such
		unions are the exception and not the rule.</p>

		<p>Broadly speaking, to make any marriage
		happy each partner ought deliberately to use
		every atom of his or her intelligence to think
		out the best method to live in sympathy with
		the mate, and should not simply be set upon
		expressing his or her own personality, regardless
		of the other. Chain any two animals together
		and watch the result! Nothing will
		<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63">&nbsp;</a>teach what marriage means more effectually.
		It is only when the two poor beasts are of one
		mind that their chains do not gall. But human
		beings are above animals in this, that they have
		wills and talents and aspirations, and can judge
		of good and evil, so that their happiness or
		misery is practically in their own hands, and to
		quote an immortal remark of a French writer&#8212;&#8220;If
		as much thought were put into the making
		a success of marriage as is put into the mixing
		of a salad, there would be no unhappy unions!&#8221;</p>

			SHOULD DIVORCE BE MADE EASIER?</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">However</span> much some of us may feel
		that divorce can never touch our personal
		lives, at least the question of it
		in regard to the nation must always be interesting;
		and now, with the Majority and Minority
		report of the Royal Commission still ringing
		in every one&#8217;s ears, it seems a moment to suggest
		some points of view upon the matter. To
		those people entirely influenced by religion as it
		is expounded from the laws laid down by the
		Church, there can be nothing to say, because,
		in the first place, their belief in the infallibility
		of these laws and the influence of their pastors
		ought certainly to keep them from sinning at
		all; and if sinned against, ought to enable them
		to bear the pain without murmur. But there
		are a vast number of our countrymen and women
		who do not consider the dogmas of religion and
		are not entirely imbued with respect for the laws
		of the Church, while nevertheless being good
		<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65">&nbsp;</a>and honest citizens. It depends upon each person&#8217;s
		point of view.</p>

		<p>In this paper, as in my former ones upon
		Marriage, I want only to take the subject from
		the standpoint of common sense, while with reverence
		I admit that if the moral conscience could
		be awakened by any religious convictions whatever,
		so that it would keep each individual from
		sinning, that would be the true solution of the
		problem. But, while seeking to enforce its laws
		in opposition to the laws of the State, the teaching
		of the Church seems somehow not to have
		been able to retain much hold over the general
		conscience which, ever since the first secular law
		came into being, has availed itself of the relief
		so afforded to free itself from galling shackles.
		The point, then, to look at sensibly is not
		whether divorce is right or wrong in itself, but
		what sort of effect the making of it easier or
		less easy would have upon the nation. There
		does not seem to be the slightest use in applying
		any arguments to the subject which do not take
		into consideration the immeasurable upheaval in
		ideas, manner of living, relaxation of personal
		discipline, and loss of religious control which
		have taken place since the last reform was made.
		The luxury of existence, the rapid movement
		<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66">&nbsp;</a>from place to place permitted by motor-cars,
		the emancipation of women, the general supposed
		necessity of indulging in amusements, have
		so altered all the notions of life, and so excited
		and encouraged interest in sex relationships, that
		the old idea of stability and loyalty in marriage
		is shaken to its foundations. The temptations
		for people to err are now a thousand-fold
		greater than they were fifty years ago, and very
		few young people are brought up with ideas of
		stern self-control at all. This being the case, it
		would seem that the only rational standpoint to
		view the question of divorce reform or divorce
		restriction from is the one which gives the vastest
		outlook over each side&#8217;s eventuality, realising
		present conditions and tendencies to be as they
		are, and not as they were, or ought to be. The
		forces which produced these conditions are not
		on the decline, but, if anything, on the increase,
		and must therefore be reckoned with and not
		ignored. What are they likely to bring in the
		future? Still greater intolerance of all restraint,
		still more desire for change? And if this is so,
		will it have been wiser to have made the law
		harder or more lenient? That is the question
		we shall soon, as a people, have to try to decide.</p>

		<p>In setting out to look calmly at the subject
		<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67">&nbsp;</a>of divorce, no good can be arrived at by studying
		isolated cases, inasmuch as surely there can
		be no divided opinion upon the fact of the
		cruelty of some of them, and the certainty of
		their betterment by divorce. The one and only
		aim to keep in view is what will be best for the
		whole people, and no other aspect should ever
		influence the true citizen in making up his mind
		upon so vital a question. Thus surely we ought
		each one of us to ask himself or herself to look
		ahead, and try to imagine what would be the
		result to our nation of relaxing the severity of
		the present divorce law&#8212;or of increasing it. Of
		the effects of its present administration we can
		judge, so it ought to be no impossible task to
		work from that backwards or forwards.</p>

		<p>But to look at any subject dispassionately,
		without the prejudice of religion or personal
		feeling, is one of the hardest things to accomplish.
		These two forces always make people
		take views as unchangeable as the laws of the
		Medes and Persians, regardless of totally altered
		conditions and requirements of mankind.
		I hold a brief for neither side, and in this paper
		I only want to suggest some points of view so
		as to help, perhaps, some others to look at the
		matter with justice, as I have tried to look at
		<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68">&nbsp;</a>it myself. It would seem to me that divorce as
		a means of ridding oneself of one partner merely
		to be happier with another must surely always
		be wrong, because it must entail the degradation
		of conscious personal motive, in the knowledge
		that one had taken advantage of a law to gain
		an end, and to help one to break a vow solely
		for one&#8217;s own gratification. The enormous responsibility
		of so taking fate into their own
		hands would frighten most people, if they gave
		themselves time to think&#8212;but they do not.
		Nine-tenths of them have no compunction in
		breaking vows, because they do not realise that
		by making them they have connected themselves
		with currents and assumed responsibilities the
		consequences of which to themselves they cannot
		possibly eventually avoid, no matter how they
		may try temporarily to evade them.</p>

		<p>It would seem to me that divorce for the rich
		and educated should be made as difficult as possible,
		and the pleas investigated mercilessly, to
		discover if any advantage has been taken of
		legal quibbles for ulterior ends; but that the
		judge should grant decrees instantly when habitual
		drunkenness, madness, or anything which degrades
		and lowers a household or community is
		proved against the defendant. It would seem to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69">&nbsp;</a>me that divorces for the poor should be facilitated
		in every way, if this difference to those of
		the rich could possibly be accomplished, so that
		the hideous cruelty and encouragement of vice
		(cases of which are so admirably set forth in
		the pamphlets issued by the Divorce Law Reform
		Union) could be summarily dealt with,
		and relief and peace conferred upon the innocent
		party. Because the lives of the poor are too
		filled with work to be as easily influenced by
		personal emotion as the lives of the rich, and
		the lower level of their education and standard
		of manners admits of such far greater unkindness
		and brutality in their actions than in a
		higher class; and thus they are the more entitled
		by justice to relief and protection than the highly
		endowed and developed section of society who
		can better take care of themselves. It seems to
		me to be a crying injustice that the law of
		divorce can only be administered by paying
		exorbitant fees for it; and that if the separation
		of two human beings who are admittedly
		bound together by law can be accomplished
		by law and that the breaking of the marriage
		vow is a sin against the law, then the poorest
		in the land have an absolute right that this
		law should be put into execution for them without
		<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70">&nbsp;</a>special payment, just as they have now a
		right to the Law&#8217;s working for them to catch
		offenders who steal their goods, or who break
		business contracts with them. It would seem
		that this is a frightful case of there being one
		law for the rich and one for the poor, and that
		it is a blot upon the boasted equity and fairness
		of English justice. How glorious it would be
		if all lawyers could be remunerated equally
		by the State! It would do away with a thriving
		industry perhaps, but it might be a great
		aid to real justice being arrived at, and not as
		things now are, when whoever can pay the
		cleverest pleader has the best chance of winning
		the case. But to get back to the views of
		divorce!</p>

		<p>It would seem to me that the vital and essential
		question all persons wishing for divorce
		ought to ask themselves is, &#8220;What is my motive
		in desiring this freedom?&#8221; They should search
		their very souls for the truth. If it is because
		the position has not only become intolerable to
		themselves, but is a menace to their children or
		society, then they should know that they are acting
		rightly in trying their utmost to be free; but
		if the real reason is that they may legally indulge
		in a new passion, then they may be certain that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71">&nbsp;</a>if they take advantage of a law designed for
		the benefit of a race, and use it to their own
		baser ends, they are invoking most dangerous
		forces to militate against their own eventual unhappiness.
		No one who is in a position where
		his or her good or bad example will be followed
		has any right to indulge in any personal feelings
		to the influencing in a harmful way of his
		or her public actions. This is the true meaning
		of that finest of all old sayings, &#8220;<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse
		oblige</em>.&#8221; To me it would seem to be a frightful
		sin for a man or woman for personal motives
		to degrade an order or a community.</p>

		<p>So this is the standpoint I would suggest
		every one looking at divorce from: &#8220;Will the
		thing bring good or harm?&#8212;not to me who am
		only a unit, but to that wider circle of my family
		and my country?&#8221; And if common sense assures
		him or her that no good can come of it,
		then the true citizen should not hesitate to bear
		the pain of refraining.</p>

		<p>It would seem to me to be wrong to allow
		any personal feeling at all to influence one to divorce,
		no matter what the cruelty of the circumstances
		or the justice of the grievance one had,
		<em>if by so doing the children of the marriage were
		injured in any way, or that the prestige of an
		<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72">&nbsp;</a>order or the honour of a family were lowered
		by one&#8217;s action</em>; but that were the husband or
		wife a shame and degradation to the children or
		the family, the individual would be entirely justified
		in divorcing, and would be helping the good
		of the State by preventing the guilty and debased
		partner from committing further harm. Common
		sense is always the truest wisdom, but it has
		often unhappily had to be cloaked and hampered
		either by spiritual superstition, prejudice, or ignorance.
		So that when a flagrant case which corrupts
		a whole neighbourhood cries aloud to common
		sense to remove it by divorce, there are
		found hundreds of good and worthy people to
		oppose this on the ground that the Church does
		not sanction such proceeding! If the State religion
		administered by the Church cannot inculcate
		higher principles in its members, so as to
		prevent them from sinning, it would obviously
		seem to be more fair to allow the statesmen and
		sociologists to have a free hand in their attempt
		to better the morality of England than for the
		Church to use the vast influence it still possesses
		to the stultifying of these plans. The homely
		proverb of the proof of the pudding being in
		the eating seems to be plainly shown here. The
		religious teaching has failed to influence the people
		<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73">&nbsp;</a>to refrain from sin and to discountenance
		divorce, proving that its method of imparting
		knowledge and obtaining influence over the
		modern mind is no longer effectual, and common
		sense would suggest changing the method to ensure
		the desired end. There is a story told of a
		French regiment in the early days of conscription.
		A certain size of boots had been decided
		upon for recruits, and this decision had worked
		very well when the young men were drawn from
		the town, where the feet were comparatively
		small, but when countryside youths became the
		majority, the boots they were given were an
		agony to them, and constant complaints were the
		result, with, however, no redress. Omnipotent
		head-quarters had decided the size! And
		that was the end of it! And it was not
		until nearly the whole regiment was in hospital
		with sore feet that it entered the brain of
		the officials that it might be wiser for France to
		regulate the size of the boots of the regiment
		to the feet of the wearers. Why, then, cannot
		the Church devote all its brain and force to
		evolving some new form of teaching which will,
		so to speak, &#8220;fit the feet of the wearers&#8221;?
		Then all questions of divorce could be settled by
		noble and exalted feeling and desire to do right
		<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74">&nbsp;</a>and elevate the nation. But meanwhile, with
		the growth and encouragement of individualism,
		every little unit is giving forth his personal view
		(as I am doing in this paper!), perhaps many of
		them without the slightest faculty for looking
		ahead, or knowledge of how to make deductions
		from past events, or other countries&#8217; experiences;
		and the Church is preaching one thing, and the
		State another, the Majority report taking a certain
		view, and the Minority a different one&#8212;and
		we are all at sea, and the supreme issue of it
		all seems to be fogged.</p>

		<p>An enormous section of the public, and almost
		all women it would seem, are of opinion that
		divorce should be granted for the same reason
		to women as it is now to men. But surely those
		who hold this view cannot understand that fundamental
		difference in the instincts of the sexes
		which I tried to show as forcibly as I could in
		my former articles upon Marriage. Infidelity in
		man cannot be nearly such a degradation to his
		own soul as infidelity in woman must be to hers,
		because he is following natural impulses and she
		is following grafted ones. A woman must feel
		degraded in her body and soul when she gives
		herself to <em>two men</em> at the same time, a husband
		and a lover; but a man, when he strays, if it has
		<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75">&nbsp;</a>any moral effect upon him at all, probably merely
		feels some twinges on account of breaking his
		word, and the fear of being found out. The
		actual infidelity cannot degrade him as much as
		it generally degrades a woman, and may be only
		the yielding to strong temptation at a given moment,
		and have no bearing upon the kind home
		treatment he accords his wife and children, or
		the tenor of his domestic life. The eventuality
		of what this law would bring should be looked
		at squarely. And it is rather a pitiful picture to
		think of the entire happiness of a home being
		upset because a wife, without judgment or the
		faculty of making deductions, discovering a
		single instance of illicit behaviour in her husband,
		sees fit to, and is enabled by law, to divorce
		him. It may be argued that the fear of
		this would make him mend his ways; but did
		fear ever curb strong natural instincts for long?&#8212;instincts
		as strong as hunger, or thirst, or desire
		to sleep? Fear could only curb such for a
		time, and then intelligence would suggest some
		new and cunning method of deceit, so as to obtain
		the desired end. The only possible way to
		ensure fidelity in a man is by influencing him to
		<em>wish</em> to remain faithful, either by fond love for
		the woman or deep religious conviction or moral
		<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76">&nbsp;</a>opinion that not to do so would degrade his
		soul. The accomplishment of this end would
		seem to be either in the hands of the woman
		or in the teaching of the Church&#8212;and cannot
		be brought about by law. Law can only punish
		offenders; it cannot force them to keep from
		sin. When a man is unfaithful habitually, it
		amounts to cruelty, and even with the present
		law the woman can obtain relief on that ground.</p>

		<p>In looking at a single case of infidelity in a
		woman, a man would be wise to question himself
		to see if he has not been in some measure
		responsible for it&#8212;by his own unkindness or
		indifference, and in not realising her nature; and
		if his conscience tells him he is to blame, then
		he ought never to be hard upon the woman. He
		ought also very seriously to consider the circumstances,
		and whether or no his children or his
		family will be hurt by the scandal of public severance,
		as they should be more important to him
		than his personal feelings. Tolerance and common
		sense should always hold wounded vanity
		and prejudice in check. How often one sees
		happy and united old couples who in the meridian
		of their lives have each looked elsewhere,
		but have had the good taste and judgment to
		make no public protest about the matter, and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77">&nbsp;</a>thus have given each other time to regain command
		of vagrant fancies and return to the fold
		of convention!</p>

		<p>With so many different individual views upon
		the right and wrong of divorce, it is impossible
		for either side&#8212;the divorce reform or the divorce
		restriction supporters&#8212;to state a wholly
		convincing case against the other. The only possible
		way to view the general question is, as I
		said before, to keep the mind fixed upon the main
		issue, <em>that of what may possibly be best for the
		nation</em>, having regard to the ever-augmenting
		forces of luxury and liberty and democracy and
		want of discipline which are holding rule.</p>

		<p>Lack of space prevents me from trying to
		touch upon the numerous other moot points in
		divorce, so I will only plead that, when each person
		has come to a definite and common-sense conclusion,
		unclouded by sentiment or prejudice, he
		or she may not hesitate to proclaim his or her
		conviction aloud, so that the law of the land may
		be reorganised to the needs of present-day humanity
		and help it to rise to the highest fulfilment.</p>

			THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MOTHERHOOD.</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">As</span> far as the necessities for it go in the animal
		world, nearly all animals have a very
		strong sense of the responsibility of motherhood&#8212;unless
		they have become over-civilised,
		or live under unnatural circumstances. A striking
		example of the consequences of the latter
		state of being is shown by &#8220;Barbara,&#8221; that
		thrillingly attractive Polar bear in the Zoo,
		whose twelfth and thirteenth infants were only
		the other day condemned to follow their
		brothers and sisters to an early grave through
		their parents&#8217;&#8212;and especially their mother&#8217;s&#8212;gross
		stupidity about their bringing-up and welfare.
		And we who are human animals, given by
		God conscious souls, ought to realise the fact
		that civilisation and pampered environment have
		enormously blunted our natural instincts in this
		respect, just as they have Barbara&#8217;s, and so we
		should try to restore the loss by consciously cultivating
		<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79">&nbsp;</a>our understanding of the subject and
		deliberately realising the tremendous responsibilities
		we incur by bringing children into the
		world. When we think about the matter quietly,
		the magnitude of it is almost overwhelming, and
		yet there are hundreds and thousands of women
		who never give it a serious thought! They
		have some vague idea that to have children is
		the inevitable result of matrimony, and that
		if they pay others to feed and clothe the
		little creatures, and give them some instruction
		in the way that they should go, their own
		part of the affair is finished. That, until a child
		is grown to an age to judge for itself, the parents
		will be held responsible for their stewardship of
		its body and soul at the great tribunal of God
		does not strike them, and it is only perhaps when
		the boomerang of their neglect has returned to
		them and blasted them with calamity that they
		become conscious of their past negligence.</p>

		<p>In this article I do not propose to touch upon
		the father&#8217;s side of the question, important as
		it is, but shall confine myself to the mother&#8217;s,
		because this has always been one of my deep
		preoccupations to think out the meaning of it
		all, and how best to fulfil the trust. Obviously
		the sole aim of true motherhood is the moral
		<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80">&nbsp;</a>and physical welfare of the child, and to accomplish
		this end we should understand that it is
		quite impossible to lay down any set rule, or
		go by any recognised and unchangeable method.
		For in one age certain precepts are taught which
		are obsolete in the next, because science and the
		improvement of mechanical aids to well-being
		advance with such giant strides. But if we keep
		<em>the end</em> in view it is simple enough to see that
		common sense and discrimination, unclouded by
		custom or sentiment or superstition, can accomplish
		miracles. The circumstances of the particular
		case must always govern the method to
		be used in order to obtain the same given end,
		no matter what the station in life of the parents.
		Thus every mother, from the humblest to the
		highest, ought to think out how she can best
		procure her child moral and physical welfare
		<em>according to her means</em>.</p>

		<p>In the lives of the very poor the only thing
		to be done for the betterment of the understanding
		of the responsibility of motherhood seems to
		be to teach the simplest rules of hygiene which
		animals know by instinct, and after that for the
		State to take care of the children as much as
		possible. For this very strange fact is in operation,
		namely, that while Nature leaves an insatiable
		<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81">&nbsp;</a>desire to create life, she allows civilisation
		to rob human beings of instinctive knowledge
		of how to preserve it in its earliest stages, and
		that the human mother is of all creation the
		only one entirely at the mercy of imparted
		knowledge as regards the proper treatment of
		her offspring.</p>

		<p>Into the conception of the duties of motherhood
		among the very poor we cannot go in this
		short paper&#8212;the subject is too vast&#8212;so we must
		confine ourselves to discussing those of a higher
		class where, having the means to do well, the
		responsibilities are far greater. I want, if I
		can, to open a window, as it were, upon the outlook
		of the general responsibility of motherhood
		and let each class apply what it gathers of the
		meaning, if it wishes, to its own circumstances.</p>

		<p>It is the aim and end of a thing which is of
		sole importance; in this case the aim and end
		being the happiness and welfare of the child.
		And that is the point which I want to harp upon,
		the necessity of keeping the goal in view and of
		not wandering off into side issues. It was for
		the sake of the end, namely, obtaining happiness,
		that I tried to show in my articles upon
		marriage how common sense might secure this
		desired state. And it was to <em>the end</em> of what
		<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82">&nbsp;</a>might be best for England that I pleaded for
		the necessity of using fair judgment over the
		question of facilitating or restricting divorce.
		And it is now to <em>the end</em> of helping the coming
		race to be fine and true that I want to talk about
		the responsibility of motherhood.</p>

		<p>Let us take the subject from the very beginning.</p>



		<h3 class="essay_section_title">PRE-NATAL INFLUENCES</h3>

		<p>The thought for the child should commence
		with the first knowledge of its coming birth.
		A tremendous control of self, and emotions, and
		foolish habits, and a stern command of nerves
		should be the prospective mother&#8217;s constant
		effort, as science has proved that all pre-natal
		influences have such powerful effect upon the
		child; and, surely, if any woman stopped to
		think of the colossal responsibility she has undertaken
		in having become the vehicle to bring
		a soul from God to earth, she would at least
		try to employ as much intelligence in the fulfilment
		of her obligation as she puts into succeeding
		in any of the worldly pursuits in life. Think
		of the hours some women spend in painful discipline
		by going through exercises to keep their
		figures young and their faces beautiful&#8212;the massage!
		<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83">&nbsp;</a>the cures! and the &#8220;rests&#8221; they take to
		this end&#8212;but who let their waiting time for
		motherhood be passed in a sort of relaxation of
		all control&#8212;getting into tempers, indulging in
		nerves, over-smoking, or tiring themselves out
		with excitement without one thought for the
		coming little one, except as an inevitable necessity
		or a shocking nuisance. During this period
		the wise woman ought to study such matters as
		heredity. She ought to view the characteristics
		of her own and her husband&#8217;s families, and then
		firmly determine to counteract the objectionable
		features in them by making her own mind dwell
		upon only good and fine attributes for her child.
		She ought to try to keep herself in perfect health
		by using common sense, and, above all, she
		should <em>determine</em> to fight and conquer the nervous
		emotions which more or less beset all
		women at such time. She ought to encourage
		happy and loving relations with her husband,
		and try in every way to be in herself good and
		gentle and brave. It is the most important moment
		in the whole of a woman&#8217;s life for self-discipline,
		because of the prodigious results of all
		her moods and actions upon the child, and yet,
		as I said before, it is one of the commonest
		sights to see a woman who at other times is a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84">&nbsp;</a>very good sort of creature, simply letting herself
		go and becoming an insupportable bore to her
		husband and the whole house, with her perverseness
		and her nerves and her fads.</p>

		<p>If they could analyse causes, what bitter reproaches
		many poor little diseased, neurotic
		children might truly throw at their irresponsible
		mothers for endowing them with these
		evils before birth.</p>



		<h3 class="essay_section_title">THE CASE OF TWO WOMEN</h3>

		<p>When the child is born&#8212;again it is only its
		welfare which should be thought of by the
		mother, and not what custom or family opinion
		would enforce. To me it seems that no mother
		ought to undertake any of the so-called duties
		of a mother that she is incapable of performing
		to the advantage of the child, who would be
		better cared for by employing highly trained
		service. She should only force herself to do her
		best in uncongenial tasks if circumstances make
		it impossible for her to obtain a better nurse or
		teacher for her infant than she herself could
		be. She must constantly keep <em>the end</em> in view,
		so as to stamp out prejudice and out-of-date
		methods; especially she should guard against
		<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85">&nbsp;</a>making the child suffer for her own fads and
		experiments. I believe I shall better illustrate
		what I mean by &#8220;keeping the end in view&#8221; if
		I give a few concrete examples, instead of trying
		to explain in the abstract.</p>

		<p>Here is one example.</p>

		<p>There were two women of my acquaintance,
		one of whom had an exquisitely obedient, perfectly
		brought-up little girl of five who was her
		constant thought, and a baby of two months.
		This mother could afford an excellent nurse, and
		left all the physical care of the infant to her,
		concentrating her intelligence upon wise general
		supervision, and upon the training of the little
		girl whose dawning character was her study.
		The other mother had two very ill-behaved,
		disobedient children of five and seven, and a
		baby of three months. She spent her time washing
		and dressing the infant, fussing over it and
		caressing it from morning to night, and interfering
		with the paid nurse, who well knew her
		duties. She was also quite indifferent to her
		appearance, and wearied her husband to death
		with her over-domesticity. But she felt herself
		to be a perfect and affectionate wife and mother,
		and strongly censured the other woman when she
		admitted that she had never washed or dressed
		<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86">&nbsp;</a>her baby, and was even rather nervous when she
		held it in case she should hurt its tender neck
		and head. But the proof that the first woman
		was a true and good guardian of God&#8217;s gift
		to her was in the finely trained little girl, and
		the proof of the second woman&#8217;s undevelopment
		from the animal stage was in her concentrated
		and, in the circumstances, unnecessary
		preoccupation with the infant, to the entire
		neglect of the character training of the elder
		children. Had they both been so poor that actual
		physical care of the infants devolved solely upon
		each mother, the first would have used all her
		intelligence to discover the sensible and common-sense
		way to carry out her duties, and the second
		would have continued using any obsolete method
		she had been accustomed to, while she lavished
		silly fuss and attention upon the baby.</p>



		<h3 class="essay_section_title">FORE-THOUGHT FOR BEAUTY</h3>

		<p>The first woman had <em>the end</em> in view; the
		second did not look ahead at all, but simply
		indulged her own selfishly animal instincts, without
		a thought of what would be best for her
		child.</p>

		<p>The apparently &#8220;good&#8221; mothers might be
		<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87">&nbsp;</a>divided into two classes&#8212;the animal mothers
		and the spiritual mothers. The animal mothers
		are better than indifferent, and therefore abnormal,
		mothers, but are far below spiritual
		mothers, for they, the animal mothers, are
		only obeying natural instincts which have happily
		survived in them, but obeying them only
		as animals do, without reason or conscience.
		And the spiritual mother uses her common sense
		and tries to secure the continual welfare of her
		child, looking ahead for all eventualities, from
		matters of health to personal appearance, as well
		as character training and soul elevation.</p>

		<p>Numbers of women think that if they follow
		out the same lines of bringing-up for their children
		as are the recognised ones employed by
		their class they have fully done their duty, and
		that if the children do not profit by the stereotyped
		lessons of religion and behaviour that
		have been imparted to them by proper teachers
		it is the fault of the children, and a misfortune
		which they, the mothers, must bear with more
		or less resignation.</p>

		<p>But indeed this is not so.</p>

		<p>Let us take a spiritual mother&#8217;s duties in
		rotation, beginning with the most material.
		After bringing into the world the healthiest infant
		<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88">&nbsp;</a>her common sense has been able to secure,
		she should guard against any physical disability
		accruing to it that she can prevent. In all matters
		of health she should either make a great
		study of the subject herself, or employ trained
		aid to its accomplishment; but beyond this there
		are other things which, if she neglects them, the
		boy or girl could reproach her for afterwards
		and with reason. One is the fore-thought for
		beauty. How many boys&#8217; whole personal appearances
		are ruined by standing-out ears! How
		many little girls&#8217; complexions are irretrievably
		spoilt by unsuitable soap having been used which
		has burnt red veins into their tender cheeks.
		These two small examples are entirely the fault
		of the mother and do not lie at the door of
		uncorrected habits in the children themselves.
		No boy&#8217;s ears need stick out; there are caps and
		every sort of contrivance yearly being improved
		upon to obviate this disfigurement. No girl need
		have anything but a beautiful skin if her mother
		uses intelligence and supervises the early treatment
		of it. Because if she has <em>the end</em> in view,
		the mother will know that her little boy or girl
		will probably grow up and desire affection and
		happiness, and that beauty is a means not to
		be discounted to obtain these good things, and,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89">&nbsp;</a>for the securing of them, is relatively as important
		as having a well-endowed mind.</p>



		<h3 class="essay_section_title">THE SPIRITUAL MOTHER</h3>

		<p>When the first dawning characteristics begin
		to show, the spiritual mother&#8217;s study of heredity
		will begin to stand her in good stead, for she
		must never forget that every expressed thought
		and action of a small child shows the indication
		of some undeveloped instinct, and should be
		watched by a sensible mother, so that she may
		decide which one to encourage and which one
		to curb, and, if possible, eradicate. Should
		there be some strong inherited tendency which
		is not good, then her most careful care and
		influence will be needed. There is not the slightest
		use in making rules and then leaving their
		enforcement to servants and governesses&#8212;the
		true mother should see that her child thoroughly
		understands what it is being asked to do, and
		why it is being asked to do it. She should
		appeal to its intelligence from earliest days, and
		make it comprehend it is for its own benefit.
		For children cannot when very young be influenced
		by high moral considerations which come
		with maturer years, but only by personal gain
		<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90">&nbsp;</a>or fear&#8212;and if ruled by fear they invariably
		become deceitful. It is a spiritual mother&#8217;s
		business to show interest in all her child&#8217;s tastes
		and occupations, and to supervise and direct
		them into the best channels, and if she has several
		children she should watch each one&#8217;s idiosyncrasies
		and not imagine that the same method
		will do for them all. What good gardener
		would treat a rose-tree in the same fashion
		which he does a tulip bulb? The spiritual
		mother should think out for herself, guided by
		what she sees are their personal needs, the best
		method of instructing her children in true morality&#8212;that
		is, honour and truth, and freedom
		from all hypocrisy and deceit. She should not
		be influenced by any set-down rules of religion
		or dogma, or by any precepts she may have been
		taught herself in her youth, if they no longer
		convey conviction because of the change in time,
		otherwise she will be following custom and
		losing sight of <em>the end</em>. She should make her
		children understand that the soiling of their own
		souls by committing mean actions is the greatest
		sin, and that what other people think or do not
		think of them is of no consequence, but the only
		vital things are what God thinks and they think
		of themselves. Hundreds of children&#8217;s afterlives
		<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91">&nbsp;</a>are shipwrecked because they were only
		taught all the dry dogmas and seemings of religion,
		and the real meaning was never explained
		to them. I know a rigorously strict clergyman&#8217;s
		family where the children are taught and conform
		to all the observances of their father&#8217;s
		church, and yet a falser, more paltry set of
		young creatures could not be found&#8212;they have
		never had it explained to them that it is impossible
		to hoodwink God. For a perfect example
		of the religious spirit <em>not to</em> employ towards
		children, all mothers ought to read the immortal
		scene between Trilby before she dies
		and Mrs. Bagot&#8212;when the narrow woman expresses
		her puny views and Trilby puts forth
		her broad and true ones. It is so incredibly
		stupid to use obsolete methods which can never
		obtain the desired end just because the dominion
		of custom is still strong upon us, and
		we have not been intelligent enough to grasp
		and benefit by the spirit of the age. For all
		mothers must realise that they can never dominate
		the spirit of the age, and must either
		make vain fights with it, and be conquered to
		their loss, or must make terms with it and use
		it in its brightest and best aspect. The spirit
		of this age is a totally different one to the spirit
		<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92">&nbsp;</a>of their own childhood&#8217;s age. It is shorn of
		reverence and unquestioning obedience to
		elders, and is an independent creature who will
		only obey through conviction of good or personal
		benefit. Children are unerring and pitiless
		judges of those placed over them, and how
		can a mother, just because she is a mother,
		expect respect and reverence in her children if
		she earns their contempt by her conduct and
		selfishness?</p>

		<p>It is the spiritual mother&#8217;s duty to instil chivalry
		towards the other sex into her little sons
		from earliest years, by making them polite to
		herself and to their sisters. She should, before
		they go to school and when they return for the
		holidays, endeavour to influence them into
		liking cleanliness and care of their persons, especially
		when with ladies. She should try to
		make these little men so happy and contented,
		so certain of sympathy and understanding that
		home spells heaven for them and remains the
		dearest memory of their lives, and for her little
		girls, over whom she has a far vaster influence,
		she should polish their minds, explain all the
		true and pure principles of life&#8212;teach them
		the value of self-control and self-respect, and
		watch for and encourage all their graces, so that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93">&nbsp;</a>when they arrive at the ages of seventeen and
		eighteen they may be fitted in all points to shine
		in whatever world they belong to, and take their
		places among the best of their class. Space forbids
		me to go on longer, although the subject
		seems only just to have been begun, so large
		is its sphere of action, but I must give one last
		concrete example of two women&#8217;s methods, to
		enforce my meaning of the importance of <em>the
		end</em>.</p>

		<p>Both sent their girls to the same school, where
		every accomplishment was taught and the highest
		tone prevailed that the masters could inculcate.
		The first mother showed deep interest in
		the holidays, in all her child&#8217;s lessons, directed
		and encouraged her, opening her understanding
		and broadening her point of view, while she
		attended to every physical grace. She explained
		how her child should apply the knowledge she
		acquired during term, so that it should grow
		interesting, and as far as it lay in her power
		she endeavoured that her daughter should be
		fitted with every charm and attraction which
		could procure for her later on a larger selection
		from which to choose her partner in life. The
		other mother let her girl run wild during the
		holidays, and allowed her to feel that all she
		<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94">&nbsp;</a>learned was just an irksome duty to be forgotten
		the moment school was over. Her appearance,
		her gentle manners, her refinement, her point of
		view, were all left to take their own chance,
		from the mistaken idea that it would encourage
		vanity and egotism in the girl to discuss these
		things with her&#8212;and that she, the mother, had
		done all that was required of her in simply providing
		a good education! This second mother
		had completely lost sight of the end, you see,
		and was unconsciously only thinking of herself
		and not of her child at all.</p>

		<p>And this&#8212;to think of the welfare of the
		child and allow no other point to obscure this&#8212;is
		the whole meaning of the responsibility of
		motherhood.</p>

			THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MOTHERHOOD.
			SECOND PAPER</h2>

		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">What</span> I always wish to impress upon
		the readers who are kind enough to
		be interested in the articles which I
		write is to keep the end aimed at in view. So
		in this second paper upon the responsibility of
		motherhood, I must begin by reiterating this
		necessity.</p>

		<p>No mother has a right to drift and trust to
		chance for the welfare of her children, and
		however they develop, for good or ill, she must
		in greater or lesser degree be held responsible.</p>

		<p>The period when animals cease all interest in
		and care for their offspring only commences
		when these latter can safely be left to look after
		themselves; and so it should be with human
		beings. But, judging the ages relatively of
		animals and mankind, numbers of human
		mothers entirely neglect their progeny long before
		they have come even to the fledgling stage!
		<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96">&nbsp;</a>How often in society one sees women of forty-five
		and younger with daughters of fifteen to
		twenty, about whose real characters and souls
		they know nothing! They have always been
		too busy with their own personal interest to
		give the time and sympathy required for a real
		mother&#8217;s understanding of her children. Servants
		and governesses have been the directors
		through the most critical period of the girls&#8217;
		lives, and it is merely a piece of luck if they
		have imbibed no ill from them.</p>

		<p>There are numbers of worthy and innocent
		women married to men whose characters have
		certain forcible and unpleasant traits, which are
		more than likely to be reproduced in their children,
		but from the limited education these good
		creatures have received, and the absence of all
		habit of personal analysation of cause and effect,
		they never realise that it is their bounden
		duty to be on the lookout for the first signs of
		the hereditary traits appearing, and the necessity
		for using special care and influence to counteract them.</p>

		<p>A woman (unless too vain) knows very well
		her own failings and her own good qualities,
		and can, if she is wise, suppress or encourage
		them when they show in her children; but she
		<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97">&nbsp;</a>cannot trace the characteristics of remote ancestors,
		or even be certain of what her husband
		has on his side endowed their joint offspring
		with, so her duty is to be on the watch from
		the very commencement, and to use her intelligence
		as she already uses it in every ordinary
		affair in life.</p>

		<p>People of even the most mediocre understanding
		are quite sensible enough to select the
		right implements to carry on any work that they
		have undertaken. A woman about to sew a fine
		piece of muslin does not dash haphazard into
		her work-basket and pick out any needle which
		comes first, and any thread, coarse or fine, which
		is handy. She would know very well that her
		work would be a sorry affair if she did so, and
		that, on the contrary, she must choose the exact
		fineness of both thread and needle to sew this
		particular bit of stuff satisfactorily, the ones she
		may have employed an hour before upon firm
		cloth being of no use for muslin.</p>

		<p>She is keeping <em>the end</em> in view.</p>


		<h3 class="essay_section_title">LOOKING AHEAD</h3>

		<p>But countless numbers of mothers never understand
		that any different method is necessary
		<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98">&nbsp;</a>with different children; they just go on in the
		old way they have been taught when young
		themselves, if they trouble at all about the
		matter.</p>

		<p>Every woman who has a child ought to ask
		herself these questions: Who is responsible for
		this child being in the world? Am I and my
		husband responsible, or is the child responsible
		itself? The answers are ridiculously obvious,
		and, when realised, the remembrance of them
		should entail grave obligations upon the parents.</p>

		<p>The mother should look ahead and try to
		determine whether or no what seems to be showing
		as the result of the ideas of up-bringing in
		the past fifteen years is good or bad.</p>

		<p>The main features of that system being the
		relaxation of all discipline and the cessation of
		the inculcation of self-control, because the
		standards suddenly became different. Formerly,
		to perform Duty (spelt with a big D!) was
		the only essential matter in life, and to obtain
		happiness was merely a thing by the way. In
		the past fifteen years the essential goal sought
		after has been happiness, and duty has been
		merely the thing by the way. But a very large
		number of the mothers of England have not
		perhaps begun to develop sufficient scope of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99">&nbsp;</a>brain to enable them to judge what will eventually
		bring happiness; they can only see the immediate
		moment, and to indulge their children&#8217;s
		every desire seems to be the simplest way. But
		they forget that during this short and impressionable
		stage of life all strength and will-power
		and self-control ought to be enforced and encouraged,
		to enable the loved children to withstand
		hardships and to attract happiness in the
		long after years. A mother should ask herself
		if it is worth while, in securing a joyous and
		irresponsible childhood and adolescence, to
		leave her children at the end of them unarmed
		and at the mercy of every adverse blast. The
		great dangers which seem to be resulting from
		the system of upbringing in the last fifteen years
		are that at seventeen or eighteen most young
		people are satiated with pleasure and blas&eacute; with
		life, while they have no definite aim or end of
		achievement in view, and absolutely no sense of
		duty or responsibility to the community.</p>


		<h3 class="essay_section_title">THE FIRST OBLIGATION</h3>

		<p>It would seem to me that a mother&#8217;s first
		obligation is to enforce discipline, and to teach
		self-control from the earliest infancy with the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100">&nbsp;</a>fondest loving care, and to transmit that sense
		of responsibility for noble citizenship into her
		children which should have been her own guiding star.</p>

		<p>But, again, to do so she must not employ
		obsolete methods without taking into account the
		spirit of the age which has aroused a sense of
		personal liberty in the youngest child, and makes
		it refuse to accept rules and regulations on trust.
		It must be convinced that they are for its good,
		or it will only bow to them by fear, learn to
		deceive, and remain rebellious and determined
		at the first opportunity to throw off the yoke
		and go its own way. I will give a concrete case
		of what I mean upon this point, to show how
		even a good woman can misunderstand the real
		meaning of the responsibility of motherhood,
		and by her method of upbringing can allow misfortune
		to fall upon her young family.</p>

		<p>Here is a lady of the highest rank, who comes
		of a steady and worthy stock, and who has been
		brought up herself strictly and well. She marries
		a man of great position, but with rather
		wild blood in his veins. She has no modern
		ideas of only desiring a small family; she wishes
		to and intends to do her duty to her state, and is
		by no means set upon personal amusement.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101">&nbsp;</a>As the years go on she becomes the mother
		of four boys and two girls. She engages the
		best nurses for them, and, later on, the best governesses
		and tutors. The children are taught
		their catechism on Sundays and are drilled
		as those of their class into having good outward
		manners and behaviour. They are given
		orders without explanations, which they are expected
		to obey unquestioningly, and they are
		duly punished when they are disobedient. They
		see their parents at stated hours each day, and
		are seemingly a well-regulated and satisfactory
		young brood.</p>

		<p>The good woman and great lady&#8217;s time is
		naturally much occupied with social duties, and
		duties to her husband&#8217;s tenants, and to various
		charities and good works in which she is interested.
		She fulfils all these admirably, and is
		generally held in affection and respect. All the
		children have been treated exactly the same by
		her, although she knows that her husband has
		a dishonourable, gambling, scapegrace brother
		who has had to be sent to Australia, and that
		her husband himself has had tastes, the reverse
		of orthodox where his emotions were concerned,
		though happily he has not jeopardised the family
		fortunes as his brother would have done had he
		<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102">&nbsp;</a>been head. All the children have been so well
		brought up and instructed in the tenets of the
		Church that she feels quite placid and sure that
		she has done all that could be expected of her,
		and is horribly surprised and distressed when
		disasters presently occur. She looks upon them
		as the will of God and fate, but feels in no way
		to blame personally.</p>


		<h3 class="essay_section_title">A HATRED OF PREACHING</h3>

		<p>It had never struck her intelligence that boys
		with such heredity in them should have been
		specially influenced and directed from earliest
		youth towards ideas of the finest honour and
		proudest responsibility in keeping unblemished
		their ancient name; that all the stupidities and
		follies of gambling should have been pointed
		out to them; that the certain temptations which
		are bound to beset the path of those in their
		position should have been fully explained to
		them&#8212;all this done in a simple, common-sense
		fashion which would convince their understanding.
		She had never thought that it would be
		wise to make them clearly comprehend why they
		should try to resist bad habits and youthful lusts
		of the flesh&#8212;not so much from the point of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103">&nbsp;</a>view that such things are sins, as because science
		and experience have shown that the indulgence
		in them spoils health and brain and pleasure in
		manhood. Boys are creatures full of common
		sense, and their education in public schools
		broadens and helps their understanding of
		logical sequences, if only things are explained
		to them without mystery and too much spiritual
		emphasis being put upon them. They so hate
		being preached at! No young, growing person
		in normal animal health and spirits can be guided
		and coerced to resist the desires of the body
		<em>solely</em> by religious and moral teaching; he must
		have some definite reward and gain upon this
		earth held out to him as well; there must be
		some tangible reason for abstinence to convince
		his imagination and strengthen his will. And
		the gain he is offered if he resists certain temptations
		is that he will grow strong and powerful,
		and the better able, when his judgment is ripe
		enough to discriminate properly, to enjoy real
		pleasures later on. When the adolescent spiritual
		self begins to rule him, then the moral point
		can be more forcibly pressed home; but it is
		quite futile while he is at the growing animal
		stage.</p>

		<p>Our good and highly placed mother of whom
		<a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104">&nbsp;</a>we are speaking has never thought of any of
		these laws of cause and effect, as applied to her
		own nearest and dearest, although she is accustomed
		to think out schemes for the betterment
		and development of her Girls&#8217; Friendly societies,
		or for furthering her husband&#8217;s political interests
		in the country.</p>


		<h3 class="essay_section_title">INHERITED CHARACTER</h3>

		<p>She sees good little well-behaved daughters
		coming down in &#8220;the children&#8217;s hour&#8221; and receives
		favourable reports from the governesses,
		and has no idea, or even any speculation about
		what strange and new thoughts and emotions
		may be commencing to germinate in their brains.
		Mildred has perhaps inherited her father&#8217;s
		<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">volage</em> nature where the other sex are concerned,
		and early shows tendencies which ought to be
		sympathetically checked and directed. Catherine
		has got a strong touch of Uncle Billy&#8217;s
		unscrupulousness, and is often deceitful and
		scheming, with a wonderful aptitude for the
		nursery dominoes and other games of chance.
		But both, taught by Fr&auml;ulein or Mademoiselle&#8212;and
		that good old Nurse Timson!&#8212;only show
		their mother their sweetest side when in her
		<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105">&nbsp;</a>company, and are meek, well-behaved little mice,
		influenced to be thus not from any moral conviction&#8212;because
		if that were so they would be
		good at all times as well&#8212;but swayed by the
		certain knowledge of personal physical gain if
		they make a good impression upon mother, and
		certain punishment and unpleasantness from the
		governesses if they do not. All goes along
		smoothly until the rising sap of nature begins
		to dominate their lives; then some outward and
		visible sign of their inherited tendencies begins
		to show, the force causing its expression being
		stronger for the time than any other thing.</p>

		<p>One of the boys gambles, and goes to the
		Jews for money. The eldest son and heir, who
		has never had the wiles of women revealed and
		explained to him, or the temptations which are
		bound to be thrust upon him because of his great
		position in the world pointed out to him, succumbs
		to the fascinations and falls into the
		snares of a cunning chorus girl. Our good
		mother and great lady has steadily avoided even
		admitting that there can be sex questions in life,
		and has rigorously banished all possible discussion
		of them as not being a subject which should
		be talked of in any nice family. She has never
		given any especial teaching to arouse pride in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106">&nbsp;</a>his old name in her eldest son, or impressed
		the great responsibility there is in the worthy
		guardianship of the fine position God has endowed
		him with. He has just been allowed to
		drift with the rest, and, unwarned and unarmed,
		has fallen in the first fight with his physical emotions.</p>


		<h3 class="essay_section_title">INSTINCTS UNCHECKED</h3>

		<p>A third son is apparently the darling of the
		gods; he is full of charm. But, fearing that
		the gambling propensities of his second brother
		should come out in him also, his parents keep
		him with special strictness and very short of
		money. The same absence of all explanations
		of the meaning of things has been his portion
		as well as that of his brothers and sisters. He
		has never been enlightened as to the possible
		workings of heredity, and shown how that as the
		vice of gambling is in the blood it will require
		special will-power to overcome it. None of
		these things has been pointed out to him, and
		so, being restive at restraint and worried for
		money, he soon slips into easy ways, and often
		allows women to help him in his difficulties.
		Uncle Billy&#8217;s instincts and his own father&#8217;s have
		combined in him. Both could have been checked
		<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107">&nbsp;</a>and diverted into sane channels with loving foresight
		and knowledge and sympathy.</p>

		<p>The fourth son goes early into the Navy, and
		the discipline and the inheritance of his mother&#8217;s
		more level qualities turn him into a splendid
		fellow; but this is mere chance, and cannot
		be counted as accruing from his mother&#8217;s
		care.</p>

		<p>Here is a case where every outward circumstance
		seemed to be propitious, and where both
		parents were good and respected members of
		their class and race. But neither had the intelligence
		to realise an end, or consciously to keep
		it in view; they were solely ruled by tradition
		and what seemed to them&#8212;especially the mother&#8212;to
		be the proper and well-established religious
		methods for the bringing up of their children.
		So the remorseless laws of cause and effect
		rolled on their Juggernaut car and crushed the
		victims.</p>

		<p>Now, if this mother had had the end&#8212;that
		of her children&#8217;s happiness and welfare&#8212;really
		in view, she would have questioned herself as to
		the best methods of obtaining that end, and
		would not have been content just to go on with
		the narrow ideas which had held sway in her
		own day, and which had perhaps then succeeded
		<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108">&nbsp;</a>very well, because, as I said before, they were
		aided by the two forces now stultified&#8212;namely,
		a tremendous discipline and a spirit of the age
		which brought no suggestion of a struggle for
		personal liberty to young minds. Had she
		thought out all these things, she would have
		understood the responsibilities of motherhood
		in their real sense, and not only in the sense
		which the outward appearance judges good.
		She would have poured love and sympathy on
		each one of her children separately and individually,
		since she was the half-cause of their coming
		to earth. She would have studied each one&#8217;s
		character, and with determined concentration
		have inculcated the necessary pride in fine actions
		in them, knowing what their pitfalls would be
		likely to be. She would have taught the simple
		religion of respect for the loan God has made
		in giving their bodies a soul, and she would have
		watched for possible signs of ill, and would
		finally have guided each one through the dangerous
		age on to the time when every man
		and woman must answer for himself and herself.</p>

		<p>Heredity is sometimes stronger than even the
		wisest bringing up; but who can say how many
		families might not have been saved and kept
		<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109">&nbsp;</a>together by a prudent and understanding mother&#8217;s
		love?</p>

		<p>There is a story, which exactly illustrates the
		point of the importance of keeping <em>the end</em> in
		view, told of the Iron Duke in the Peninsular
		War. I cannot remember the exact details, and
		they are of no consequence. The point is this:
		There was a certain tremendously obstinate
		Spanish general whom the Duke (then Sir
		Arthur Wellesley) found very difficult to lead.
		The moment had arrived when it was absolutely
		necessary for success that this general should
		move his troops to a certain position. He was
		a man filled with his own importance, and he
		refused huffily to do so unless the English chief
		went down upon his knees to him!</p>

		<p>The Iron Duke is reported to have replied
		to this message in some such words as these:
		&#8220;Good Lord! the winning of the day is the
		essential thing, not the resisting of the man&#8217;s
		vanity! I&#8217;ll go down upon my knees with pleasure
		if that will make him move his troops!&#8221;
		He did, and the Spanish general conceded the
		request and the day was won.</p>

		<p>The great commander and astute Englishman
		had <em>the end</em> in view, you see, whereas the lesser
		brain of the Spaniard would have sacrificed the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110">&nbsp;</a>battle for a personal whim, having lost sight,
		in his vanity, of the importance of the main
		issue.</p>

		<p>How many parents do this day after day and
		year after year, clinging to obsolete methods,
		trying to rule by worn-out precepts, all because&#8212;when
		you come to analyse it&#8212;their own sense
		of importance really matters to them more than
		their children&#8217;s welfare, and no one has opened
		their eyes to see themselves and their actions in
		the true light.</p>

		<p>Although the case which I have just given
		of the seemingly good mother was drawn from
		the highest class, and so at first sight might not
		be said to apply to lesser grades, yet I want to
		show that this is not so, but that the same principle
		applies to the most modest little family.</p>

		<p>Every mother should study how best she can
		develop and elevate the souls which by her own
		part-action she has brought into being, and make
		that aim her first thought&#8212;for surely the satisfaction
		of the feeling that one has succeeded
		in training one&#8217;s own children to high ideals
		and the attainment of happiness would be
		greater in old age than any gratification from the
		acquirement of social supremacy or realised personal
		ambitions.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111">&nbsp;</a>I would implore every mother, of any class,
		ruthlessly to reject all the rules which she has
		been taught for the guidance of her family, <em>unless
		she has proved with common sense that they
		can be profitably applied to each particular case</em>.
		I would ask her to keep to no transmitted
		axiom, <em>unless it comes up to the requirements
		of the ever-changing and ever-advancing day</em>.
		There is only one unchangeable and immutable
		command which we should follow, and this is
		that we should not soil our souls, or render them
		up to God degraded and smirched when we go
		hence upon that journey from whence no man
		returneth.</p>

		<p>In summing up both my articles upon the responsibility
		of motherhood, I find that in this
		second one I have made two statements which
		might read as contradictions. Firstly, I spoke
		of young people requiring personal gain to be
		held out to them as a reason for committing, or
		refraining from committing, certain actions; and
		then, a paragraph or two afterwards, I gave the
		illustration of the little girls&#8217; good behaviour
		to their mother as being only caused by the
		fact that it was more to their advantage so to
		behave. What I meant to show was that while
		boys are young and full of the rising impulses
		<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112">&nbsp;</a>of nature they very rarely can have acquired
		sufficient spiritual belief to make them refrain
		from indulging in certain pleasures&#8212;or what
		seem pleasures to them&#8212;merely because they
		have been told these pleasures are wrong. For
		instance, on the subject of smoking. What boy
		will stop smoking by being told it is wrong and
		that he is sinning by his disobedience? But there
		are many intelligent ones who will not indulge
		in it if it is explained to them that smoking
		will stop their growth and make them less likely
		to succeed in the cricket eleven, or, later, in the
		college eight. At that period the mind cannot
		look into unseen worlds, and is mainly occupied
		with realities from day to day, and therefore is
		more likely to be influenced by a simple explanation
		of what physical harm or what good in the
		immediate future will be the result of actions.</p>

		<p>The little girls&#8217; behaviour to their mother
		is really an example of this same rule, only the
		principle for their action was not good, being
		merely temporary and strictly limited gain, and
		not that they should, as in the case of the boys,
		grow into fine, strong and healthy people, more
		able to enjoy life in the future.</p>

		<p>There is another statement which I have constantly
		made which possibly might be twisted
		<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113">&nbsp;</a>or misunderstood, and that is the one of the
		importance of the end. There are people who
		would turn it into the Jesuitical motto of &#8220;The
		end justifies the means.&#8221; That is not what I
		wished to convey at all, but that if an end is
		good&#8212;and the main object, admittedly, is to
		obtain it&#8212;then there is no use in using methods
		which once might have accomplished this, but
		which no longer are practical because of the
		changed conditions, and if continued in will only
		lose all possibility of success.</p>

		<p>How many fathers and mothers in past days
		have driven their offspring to disgrace and even
		death by adhering to harsh, Puritanical systems,
		out of date even at that time! And how many
		more to-day let them slip into the same abysses
		by their too indulgent rule!</p>

		<p>As I have said, over and over again, the proof
		of any pudding is in the eating of it; so let
		every mother <em>examine her methods with her children
		by this standard: Are the children developing
		in moral and physical welfare by those which
		she is using, or are they retrogressing?</em> Is she
		employing tact to guide their young fierce spirits,
		or is she trying to crush them by old-fashioned
		rules?</p>

		<p>Questions such as these ought to be honestly
		<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114">&nbsp;</a>asked by each mother of herself, and if the
		answer proves that retrogression is in progress,
		then she should not be so incredibly stupid as
		to continue in her old lines, but should examine
		herself and see how she can find the right new
		ones for her particular cases. La Rochefoucauld
		was wise when he said that vanity was at the
		root of most human mistakes. If a woman is
		not willing to undertake the true responsibility
		of motherhood, then she had far better be that
		sad thing which is a growing quantity in modern
		civilisation, namely, a childless wife devoted to
		dogs. Hundreds of selfish, neurotic females
		show the utmost unselfish devotion to wretched
		little pet animals, when the slightest self-denial
		asked of them for little human atoms is more
		than they can accord. What does this mean? Is
		it a writing upon the wall?</p>
